And, uh, uh, on behalf of, uh, Dana Wolfe, our executive producer and myself, uh, I\u2019m just, uh, thrilled to welcome you. When we scheduled this event some, uh, five months ago, we had no idea it would be so timely. Just in the past month the, uh, Mitchell Report was released, naming some eighty eight Major League Baseball players alleged to have used steroids and, uh, uh, other drugs. Roger Clemens\u2019 denials have been heard in 60 Minutes and were front page news in Sunday\u2019s New York Times. Uh, record breaking sprinter Marion Jones was sentenced to six weeks in prison-, or six months, I The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d should say, in prison, for lying to a federal grand jury about steroid use. Uh, Congressional hearings, uh, on steroid use and the Mitchell Report actually started today in Washington. Uh, closer to home, just a few days ago, Ben Johnson dropped out as our panelist on his counsel\u2019s insistence, because of Johnson\u2019s involvement in a le-, a related legal case that was just noticed for trial. Well timely we certainly are, but what is the debate? This is not a debate about whether cheating in sports should be accepted. That would hardly be interesting. Instead, it\u2019s about whether the rules governing professional sports should ban performance-enhancing drugs. After all, we routinely use performance-enhancing drugs, uh, to enhance our, uh, mental performance. A virtual pharmacopoeia of drugs is used to help people, including minors, stay awake, improve concentration, alter moods. And the whole point of competitive sports is for spectators to see athletes striving to be the very best they can be. We want their training and equipment to use the best science and technology. So why is the use of performance-enhancing drugs an exception? Is there persuasive evidence that these drugs are health risks? If so, how do those risks stack up against the risk athletes assume every day by getting into a racing car or a boxing ring, or on a football field or a baseball diamond? Why shouldn\u2019t athletes make their own informed determinations about risks and benefits of performance-enhancing drugs? And how should we The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d think about the wisdom of rules that are inherently so intrusive and difficult to enforce? Well to help us grapple with these interesting questions, we have an exciting panel, including professional athletes and medical experts. And as our moderator, we have Bob Costas, perhaps the most famous sportscaster in television and radio today.

So this is the sixth debate of the second Intelligence Squared US Series. The resolution being debated tonight is formally, you know what it is, but formally it is, we should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports. Here\u2019s a brief overview of the way the evening will work. Members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument, and the presentations are limited to seven minutes each. When opening arguments are complete, I\u2019ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience. And after the Q&A, each debater will make a final two minute summation. And finally, you vote on tonight\u2019s motion with the keypad attached to the armrest of your seat, and I\u2019ll announce your decision on which side carried the day or the evening, when, uh, the festivities conclude. Let\u2019s start with a pre-debate vote. Please pick up the keypad attached to the armrest on your left. For audience members sitting along the aisle to my right, your keypad is attached to the audience on your right side next to your The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d neighbor. So, the resolution is, we should accept performance- enhancing drugs in competitive sports. After my prompt, please press one to vote for the motion, two to vote against the motion, or three if you are undecided. You may begin voting now. Has everybody cast their initial vote? You\u2019re all set? All right. Now to introduce the panel. And please hold your applause until all six are introduced. For the motion, former policy analyst for the Cato Institute, senior editor and investigative journalist for Reason magazine, Radley Balko on the far end. Professor of pediatrics and bio-ethics, and director of the program in medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin, Norman Fost. And Uehiro chair in practical ethics at the University of Oxford, and director of the Oxford Center for Practical Ethics, Julian Savulescu. Against the motion, former host and creator of the Sports Machine, the award-winning sportscaster George Michael. The former Atlanta Brave two-time National League MVP, multiple Golden glo-, Glove Award-winner, and founder of the I Won\u2019t Cheat Foundation, Dale Murphy. And the former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency from 1999 through 2007, chancellor of McGill University and partner at the Canadian law firm Stikeman Elliot, Richard Pound. For most of the evening as points of view are exchanged, all of us will be seated, but as each debater makes his initial seven minute presentation, we will call him to the podium. And we will begin The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d with someone who is for the motion, \u201cWe should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports,\u201d Norm Fost. Norm?"], "speaker": "Bob Costas", "nontext": {"pause": [[0, 237]], "applause": [[0, 396]]}}, {"speakertype": "for", "segment": 0, "paragraphs": ["Thank you. Everyone in this room uses performance-enhancing technology and drugs. We use cars and computers to make our work more efficient. We use caffeine, alcohol, and Viagra to improve our performance. We send our children to fancy schools and Suzuki lessons to improve their cognitive skills, and enhance their musical ability. And every athlete in recorded history has used performance-enhancing drugs. Babylonians and Romans used herbs to improve their performance in battle. Naked Greeks put on shoes to run faster. Kenyan runners trained at altitude to improve their oxygen-carrying capacity. And runners everywhere carbo-loaded before races to enhance their performance. Why then, do we have a replay of the Salem witch trials? To discredit, humiliate, and incarcerate, uh, elite athletes for doing what has been a standard practice for millennia? And why, out of the thousand and one ways in which athletes enhance their performance, have steroids and growth hormone been selected for particular vilification? The short answer is that they\u2019re illegal and that these athletes are breaking the rules and perhaps the law, and therefor it\u2019s immoral. But this begs the question, as Mr. Rosenkranz said, why are they banned in the first place? We The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d contend that the reasons given are morally incoherent, wreak of hypocrisy, and are based on ice cold wrong information. I will identify six reasons that are offered why we should ban these drugs. Number one, critics say that they confer an unfair advantage. But advantages are only unfair if they\u2019re unequally distributed. The usual solution is to expand access. When Bob Seagren showed up at the \u201972 Olympics in-, with a fiberglass pole, it was not banned, but, a-, uh, there was a time to allow others to practice with it, and it was incorporated. When Kenyan runners were found to enhance their performance by raising their hemoglobin by training at altitude, the reaction was not to ban abnormally high hemoglobins, or to prohibit others from training at altitude, but to encourage everyone to do it. The unfair advantage aim, uh, the unfair advantage claim is further undermined by rampant hypocrisy. In the \u201988 Olympics, when Ben Johnson lost his gold medal because of steroid use, on the same day and the same press den, Janet Evans, the American swimmer who had won the 5k swim, bragged about the greasy swimsuit that we had kept secret from the East Germans. Johnson used a drug that was available to everyone, although illegally, virtually on the training room tables. Evans used a secret technology available to none of her competitors and bragged about it. The press cheered American ingenuity and made Johnson a pariah. Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d preaches about a level playing field, but presides over a league where the Yankees\u2019 payroll is three to four times that of most competitors, including my beloved Brewers, and guess what? The Yankees always make the playoffs. Two, critics say these drugs are harmful, but they rely on information that\u2019s wiley-, wildly exaggerated or just fabricated. We are told repeatedly that these drugs use heart disease, cancer, and stroke, while human growth hormone has been given to almost a million children for fifty years, and there\u2019s still no real serious side effects that have been discovered. Oral testosterone dis-, did cause liver cancer, but for twenty years athletes have been using injectables, which have never been associated with cancer. Lyle Alzado the football player, was a poster child for the horrors of steroids. He died of a brain tumor. Then the New York Times and Sports Illustrated told us on cover stories that this was due to steroids without a single quote from an informed physician or a single source showing any association with steroids, because there is none. But still, Costas, I mean, excuse me, uh,", "\u2026eh\u2026Alzado is constantly rolled out as a poster child for the horrors of steroids. I ask you in the audience to quickly name, in The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d your own minds, a single elite athlete who\u2019s had a stroke or a heart attack while playing sports. It\u2019s hard to come up with one. Anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects: acne, baldness, voice changes, intrangent infertility. But sport itself is far more dangerous, and we don\u2019t prohibit it. The number of deaths from playing professional football and college football are fifty to a hundred times higher than even the wild exaggerations about steroids. More people have died playing baseball than have died of steroid use. Three critics say that allowing their use is coercive, that you\u2019re forced to use them. But the first year that baseball did universal testing, anonymous testing, only six percent of the players were positive. From those numbers, it seems that 94% were able to play at a very high level and didn\u2019t feel coerced at all. Coercion is the use or threat of force that's never occurred in this country to the best of my knowledge. There is no entitlement to play professional sports; it\u2019s a privilege requiring an enormous sacrifice and taking on enormous risks, with or without steroids. Many walk away from it and choose not to do it, and no one is forced to take it on. Four, critics claim that steroids undermine fan interest, and this is simply empirically false, baseball attendance has ridden steadily in the steroid era, professional football is even more popular, and Barry Bonds, widely assumed to be a steroid user, is the biggest draw in sports, adding ten thousand fannies in the seats everywhere he The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d goes. Chicks love the long ball, guys love the long ball, they don\u2019t care what they're using. Fifth, critics claim that steroids undermine the integrity of records. This is na\u00efve, the records are not comparable with or without steroids or growth hormone. Baseball fences are shorter, the mound is lower, the ball is livelier, and Coors Field is a mile above sea level. By one estimate, Babe Ruth playing in today\u2019s ball parks would hit a thousand home runs, not the mere seven hundred and fifty that Hank Aaron and Bonds have hit. The only valid comparison is with peers playing in the same arenas with the same equipment against the same opponents, and Ruth hit more home runs in one season than any other team. He is in a league of his own, and no one has come close. Finally, critics claim that steroids present bad role modeling for children\u2014", "Everyone agrees these drugs should be banned for children.

And now speaking against the motion, Dick Pound."], "speaker": "Bob Costas", "nontext": {}}, {"speakertype": "against", "segment": 0, "paragraphs": ["Thank you. This evening\u2019s debate deals with one of the most important problems facing sport today: doping, the use of performance enhancing drugs and methods. It\u2019s important because it affects the health of the athletes who practice it, and those who emulate the sport heroes thought they admire. It\u2019s important because it goes to the very heart of sport and its integrity. I want to focus on two elements in this portion of my remarks: health and integrity. So let\u2019s start at the beginning. Sport, like this debate, is governed by rules, to which the participants agree. In fact, the rules are the essential element of sport as we know it. Some of them may seem arbitrary, why the race is a hundred meters as opposed to ninety-five or a hundred and five, but they are the rules, and they are the rules on which we agree. One of those sport rules is that participants do not take certain drugs or use certain methods for performance enhancement. And also, we should be clear here, until there is a rule against the use of something, it may be foolish, it may be The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d dangerous, but it can't be criticized as a breach of ethics or a rule of conduct. Don\u2019t get led off into the wilderness by examples from ancient Greece and so forth that preceded the rules that we now face today. Once there is a rule, however, that becomes the deal, and part of the game, whether the rule relates to drugs, equipment, or anything else central to the sport. And those rules become our deal with each other\u2019s, other, as participants. If you don\u2019t like the rules, unlike society in general, you're not obliged to participate. You can find somebody who wants to play by the rules that you prefer. Almost all of the prohibited substances and methods have the potential to damage the health of the athletes. In the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s before there were rules, veterinary products were used to beef up the human cattle. Shot putters went from throwing from sixty feet to seventy feet. It\u2019s true, they had terminal acne, testicles the size of jelly beans, a sperm count of zero, and were in a perpetual rage, but boy, they could sure toss the shot a lot further. The initial anti-doping rules were adopted mainly as a result of concerns regarding health. A Danish cyclist died during the 1960 Olympics in Rome, that was the Olympics in which I participated. And he died as a result of drug use. He didn't just get sick, or incur a long term health problem, or fall off his bike and skin his knees. He died. If a particular sport rule proves to be no good or unnecessary, or in need of amendment, the sport can change it. There\u2019s no problem The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d about that. But you as a participant cannot do it unilaterally and clandestinely. Why do you suppose that no one, no one with any responsibility, let me underline that, is willing to say let the athletes do whatever they want? Even the professional leagues don\u2019t say that. They know perfectly well there\u2019s a danger to health. With the rules comes a question of trust. We have expectations of each other that we play in accordance with the rules that we agreed upon as part of our participation, including rules prohibiting drug use. We\u2019re ready to demonstrate that compliance at any time, that\u2019s also part of our deal. We don\u2019t hide behind spurious claims of privacy. We agree on the penalties if there\u2019s a breach of the rules. And the sport rules on drug use are no different from sport rules regarding such things as gambling. Pete Rose has been kept out of the Baseball Hall of Fame because of gambling, because nobody was really sure whether they were watching real sport. In the, in more modern times, my, my view is that Henry Aaron has a record, Barry Bonds has a number. When there\u2019s a breach of that trust, you have to see what it is. And drug use in sport is no more or no less than cheating, and in most cases, dangerous cheating. Remember that, that athletes don\u2019t take these drugs to level the playing field. They do it to get an advantage. And if everyone else is doing what they're doing, then instead of taking ten grams or ten cc's or whatever it is, they\u2019ll take twenty, or thirty, or forty, The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d and a vicious circle simply gets bigger. The end game will be an activity that\u2019s increasingly violent, extreme, and meaningless, practiced by a class of chemical and/or genetic mutant gladiators. The use of performance enhancing drugs is not accidental, it is planned and deliberate with the sole objective of getting an unfair advantage. I don\u2019t want my kids, or your kids, or anybody\u2019s kids to have to turn themselves into chemical stockpiles just because there are cheaters out there who don\u2019t care what they promised when they started to participate. I don\u2019t want my kids in the hands of a coach who would encourage, condone, or allow the use of drugs among his or her athletes. I was always struck by Vince Lombardi, a wonderful coach. There\u2019s one thing he said that I wish he hadn't, when he said, \u201cWinning is the only thing.\u201d It\u2019s not. I liked it much better when he said, \u201cIf you're not fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm.\u201d That\u2019s a much better message. So, going forward, what we need is an increased change of attitude. Cheating in sport destroys everything\u2014", "\u2026that the athletes set out to accomplish. It turns them, among other things, into liars. Marion Jones persisted with a lie for more than seven years. Ben Johnson lied to me in 1988.

If, if ten years ago I had said that in ten years from today it would be illegal to smoke a cigarette in a restaurant in Paris, you\u2019d have laughed. So, it\u2019s important for me to keep up, keep the question of doping and drug use from becoming banal and being turned into various shades of gray.

On the train ride from DC this morning, we passed through Baltimore. Doing so reminded me of one of my favorite authors, Baltimore native H.L. Mencken, who I think would have had a good laugh at the hypocrisy, the posturing, the uh, moral prudery that\u2019s associated with this steroid controversy. Eighty years ago Mencken aptly summarized this debate when he wrote, quote, \u201cThe urge to save humanity is almost always a false face for the urge to rule it.\u201d So why are we here tonight? Is this about saving sport, or is this about some people imposing their view about what sport should be? If we\u2019re here to talk about fairness in competition, I'm dubious. Take representative Tom Davis, one of the more cam-, camera hungry politicians to demagogue this issue. After the 2000 census, Representative Davis maneuvered to have his Congressional District gerrymandered to include as many Republicans as possible, ensuring his continual reelection, eliminating the real number of options for his constituents to vote. He ran the next year unopposed. Davis also snuck a, a provision into an unrelated piece of Federal legislation preventing an apartment complex from going up in his district because, he told the Washington Post, he feared it would bring too many The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d Democrats into the district. This guy is cheating at Democracy, and he\u2019s lecturing baseball players about fairness. If we want to talk about the health risks of professional sports, we might discuss the ballooning weight of NFL lineman over the last twenty years, or the corresponding life, drop in life expectancy that\u2019s come with it. Or you might talk about the particularly hellish world of thoroughbred horse racing jockeys, who subject themselves to sweat boxes, diuretics, suppositories, and intentional eating disorders. In fact, any world class athlete subjects his body to stresses it wasn\u2019t really designed to endure. And as we\u2019ve seen with government bans on consensual activity, from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution, prohibitions not only don\u2019t work, they make the activity in question more dangerous by pushing it underground. So what about the children? Survey data actually shows that teen steroid use has mirrored the use of other elicit drugs over the years. It went up mildly in the 1990\u2019s, and has since either dropped off slightly, or leveled off since 2000. It\u2019s likely that the same trends that govern cocaine or marijuana use govern teen steroid use far more than what\u2019s happening in the sports pages. In fact, a study released last year, and one of the few studies to actually attempt to find out what motivates teen boys to take steroids, found that the most reliable indicator of steroid use was a teen\u2019s own self, self esteem and body image. The suggestion, and I think we can all The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d agree it\u2019s pretty intuitive, is that teenage boys who do take steroids do so not because they want to look like Barry Bonds or Mark McGwire, but because they want to look good for teenage girls. So what is this debate really all about? I\u2019d suggest it\u2019s about paternalism, and it\u2019s about control. We have a full blown moral panic on our hands here, and it\u2019s over a set of substances that, for whatever reason, has attracted the ire of the people who have made it their job to tell us what is and isn't good for us. Our society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with pharmaceuticals and medical technology. If something could be said to be natural, we tend to be OK with it. If it\u2019s lab made or synthetic, we tend to be leery. But even synthetic drugs and man-made technology seem to be OK if the aim is to make sick people better, or broken people whole again. And so when we talk about expanding or transcending what we consider to be normal, uh, then a certain uneasiness starts to set in. There was an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education last month about university professors taking stimulants like Adderall to increase their academic productivity. Oddly, the article quoted, quoted several professors who considered this cheating at academics. I have to confess, I really don\u2019t understand this way of thinking. Academics is the search for truth and knowledge, if a drug can make that search more productive with few side effects, why in the world wouldn't you take it? It\u2019s also important to note that The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d what we consider completely natural and acceptable today was quite out of the ordinary not too long ago. A hundred years ago life expectancy in the US was fifty, today it\u2019s seventy-eight. Thanks to technology, medicine, and pharmaceutical, we\u2019re today taller, stronger, faster, healthier, and expecting to live longer than ever before. Genetically advanced agriculture, anti-aging technology, and other advancements we\u2019ve yet to see today will likely push our longevity even farther. It\u2019s an old clich\u00e9 that sports is a metaphor for the human condition, but there\u2019s a lot of truth to that. As technology helped humanity obliterate a lot of these milestones, and helped us move beyond what, until a hundred years ago, had been a long, bleak history, similar advances over the years in nutrition, training, and using technology to improve technique have enabled sports records to fall with astonishing regularity. Sports is about exploring and stretching the lengths of human potential. Going back to even the pre-modern Olympics, when athletes ate live bees, and ate crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition, uh, sports has never been about physical ability alone. It\u2019s been, been about ingenuity, innovation, and knowledge about what makes us faster and stronger, and avoiding what might do us harm. It\u2019s always been part of the game. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that many of the biggest proponents of banning performance enhancing drugs in sports are also suspect of some The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d of these continued advancements in human achievement. Leon Kass, former, formerly President Bush\u2019s top advisor on bio-ethics, this is the same Mr. Kass who champions rigorous sports testing, has also spent much of his career actually lamenting the fact that human beings are living longer than ever before. He considers this contrary to some odd concept of natural order. Uh, of course there have been luddites and naturalists like Mr. Kass standing athwart the tide\u2014", "\u2026of human progress for much of human history. The essence of the agreement today I think is what people like Mr. Kass and some of our opponents tonight, they have a decidedly different definition of what\u2019s pure, natural, and human than what I do. I think the difference is that I'm sort of willing to take a live and let live approach and let everyone sort of explore their own boundaries and their own potential. Um, whereas I think some of our opponents are more interested in opposing their view of what is natural and what is, uh, human on everyone else, which of course brings us back to Mencken.

Accurately just mentioned, studies, recent studies are showing that young athletes and high school kids are, are using performance enhancing drugs to a lesser degree. To legitimize, um, the performance enhancing drugs in sports I feel would send the wrong message to young athletes. There are certainly legitimate uses for human growth hormone and steroids, um, as, as we all know. That\u2019s why they\u2019re a controlled substance under a doctor\u2019s orders. But to hit a baseball further, or to run a hundred yard dash faster is not the reason and the legitimate use of these, uh, of these drugs. Um, Dr. Fost mentioned that at one point in time there were six percent that were using, um, performance enhancing drugs in the major leagues. It really makes my point exactly. Ninety-four percent of the guys were not using, then that tells me that you don\u2019t need these things to be the best athlete in the world, that there are plenty of legitimate ways to get bigger, stronger, and faster that everyone has access to, equal access to. Um, if accepted, what about those, for instance, in Major League Baseball, what about those who do not want to use it? The The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d playing field, then, once again, is, is not level. Um, the only way, someone said earlier, the only way you could probably make this work is that if you forced everybody to take performance enhancing drugs, which um, we all know wouldn't work. Um, people do not want to see, I would argue the point that people do not want to see performances, uh, based on, uh, false premises, that it is, it is their ability, athletically or psychologically or mentally, alone, um, that if it\u2019s being enhanced people do not want, accept that. You mentioned Barry Bonds adding, um, seats, um, fans in the seats every game he played. I would have to say that in San Francisco he was, um, generally accepted, but everywhere else he went, I think those ten thousand extra went there to jeer him and his accomplishments. After the season, after all this has come out with Mark McGwire, I think most of us look back now and say we got caught up in something that we really didn't want to support. If there was no alternative, I could understand us giving into this problem. Certainly there are a lot of problems that young people have and society has. But this is one of them. If, uh, if there are a, a percentage of young athletes still taking performance enhancing drugs, to me it\u2019s still a problem. Um, and if there was no answer to, uh, this problem I think I would understand giving in, and voting, uh, in favor of this motion. But I believe that there is a pro\u2014there is an answer to the problem. And, uh, as was mentioned earlier we look at The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d smoking in public. Uh, we\u2014 most of us grew up with that being totally acceptable and now it\u2019s against the law, there\u2019s truly been a culture change. There can be a change in culture in professional athletics, and I believe that it is starting. We need, uh, better testing, harsher punishments, and, and people will decide not to get involved with performance-enhancing drugs. Uh, gambling in baseball is the perfect example. Um, the culture of, uh, professional baseball players is the one thing they know, and, and one thing they learn from the minute they sign a professional contract, is that if you gamble on the game in any way, shape or form, your career will be over. Uh, my understanding is, uh, I don\u2019t have any statistics to show this, but once one of the greatest hitters, uh, is kicked out of the game because he gambled on the sport, that reinforced the culture in baseball that you don\u2019t gamble on baseball. I believe we can change the culture, and to accept this motion, really would set us back with the progress that we have made. After tonight, I think you will see\u2014you will feel, uh, as you listen closely, that, you feel as I do, that there is no sustainable, logical, reasonable, um, uh\u2026 reason, for these things to be accepted. If you put any of these, uh, alleg\u2014these, uh, positions under scrutiny, I think you will all come to understand, that we simply do not need this in sports at any level. Let alone the high school kids that see professional athletes and are tempted to use them. If you put an age limit on The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d use, you\u2019re still gonna have abuse at the younger ages. To me it\u2019d be much better\u2026to change the culture and the idea and the thinking about competing in sports. And we are making progress, and studies have shown that. Certainly we don\u2019t want all of our athletes to look like the American Gladi\u2014Gladiators or professional wrestlers. Um\u2026if, if that\u2019s what we want, with all of our ath\u2014athletes, um, then I can understand that but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the public wants. As far as baseball is concerned, certainly people like the long ball. Um, but, uh, this, this past year was, in the la\u2014in the last 10 years, this past year, had the seventh fewest home runs of the last decade, and yet we broke records again with attendance. Attendance is good, home runs do not have to be up. People love the game, they appreciate the game, they appreciate finesse. Um, again, we don\u2019t all want to look like professional wrestlers out there and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the fans want.

And when asked precisely how often that was he said, almost always. Another Tour de France, Jacques Anquetil in a debate with a French politician said, what do you expect us to do, ride the tour on mineral water? Where our team agrees with, uh, Dick Pound and, and, uh, the opposition is that this is really only the tip of the iceberg. The war on drugs has failed, drugs have always been present in sport, and we\u2019re only seeing probably less than 5 percent of the drug-takers being caught. Not only has it failed, it The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d must fail. Growth hormone is extremely difficult to detect, blood doping is also extremely difficult to detect, and in the future we\u2019ll have gene doping. Insulin-like growth factor can be injected into muscles, to improve muscular strength, it would have to be detected with a muscle biopsy. Uh, science has created super- mice capable of running six, uh, kilometers instead of 200 meters, by altering their glucose metabolism. They\u2019ve created Schwarzenegger mice with vastly stronger muscles and marathon mice capable of running much faster marathons, these could all be done in humans. We will not be able to detect these changes. Not only is the war on drugs bound to fail, uh, it also has other adverse effects, it reduces interest, this year, uh, in the Tour de France the race leader Michael Rasmussen, was, uh, sacked by his team on allegations of taking drugs. There\u2019s always a cloud over winners, of whether they\u2019re taking drugs or not. It\u2019s unfair, the honest athletes are penalized because they\u2019re denied access to safe performance enhancers and of course the rich can buy the undetectable enhancers. They can buy hypoxic air tents for 7000 US dollars which are legal, whereas EPO, which is banned, costs only 120 US dollars a month. But most of all it\u2019s unsafe. What happens is there\u2019s pressure to develop undetectable performance enhancers with no eye to the safety. The BALCO scandal illustrates what a back yard situation we have at the moment. What is policy and the current zero-tolerance approach The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d to drugs in sport, is inconsistent and confused. External technologies like hypoxic air tents, or altitude training, are acceptable, they raise the red blood cell level, yet if we do this directly by retransfusing our own blood, blood doping, or using EPO, a natural hormone, that\u2019s illegal. Yet they all have exactly the same effect. Some enhancers have been permitted in sport. Caffeine increases the time to exhaustion, or reduces the time, uh, increases the time to exhaustion by 20 percent. It used to be illegal, athletes were stripped of their medals for taking caffeine, it\u2019s now legal, and it hasn\u2019t corrupted the spirit of sport, it hasn\u2019t had the effect of creating violent mutant gladiators, as the opposition has suggested. Creatine also increase the time to exhaustion by 10 percent, it\u2019s also legal. Tour de France riders use intravenous nutrition to give them enough calories, uh, overnight, and of course Tiger Woods has used lasik eye surgery to give him better than 20/20 vision. None of these have had adverse effect on sport. One of the major arguments is that it\u2019s against the spirit and integrity of sport, Dick Pound wrote\u2014raised this issue. When Dick Pound was asked in an interview with the New York Times which performance enhancements he thought were against the spirit of sport he said, it\u2019s like pornography. You know it when you see it. Well of course D.H. Lawrence\u2019s novels were thought to be pornographic a century ago, they\u2019re not now. Professional classical musicians regularly take beta blockers to The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d reduce, trim and enhance their performance. The music sounds good, it\u2019s not against the spirit of music. The spirit of sport is entailed in what sport is, it\u2019s the display of human physical excellence. Indeed, just as we can increase the artistic expression through the use of beta blockers to enhance musical performance we could use them to enhance performance in archery, or indeed, in many, uh, sports requiring control of anxiety. Ben Johnson famously said, the human body was not meant to run at the speeds it\u2019s asked to run today. To recover from the grueling training necessary to run those times you need steroids to increa\u2014increase recovery. And of course, Tiger Woods has used lasik eye surgery, and that hasn\u2019t been seen to compromise the spirit of golf. To say that we should reduce\u2026drugs in sport or eliminate them because they increase performance, is simply like saying that we should eliminate alcohol from parties because it increases sociability. So our proposal, is that we allow a modest approach. We allow performance enhancers which are safe, and consistent with the risks that athletes already entail. You\u2019ll notice that Dick Bou\u2014 Dick Pound has had to reel out examples from the \u201860s of deaths from steroids, when they were taken orally. And indeed the blood doping deaths all occurred in the \u201890s before the International Cycling Union set a maximum hem\u2014hematocrit of 50 percent. No athlete today is dying in competition from taking The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d EPO. Indeed I would prefer to take growth hormone prescribed by a doctor, than compete in professional American football, because I know of no ventilator-dependent quadriplegic caused by taking growth hormone. The drugs need to be consistent with the spirit of an activity, creating webbed hands and feet, which is possible, which is possible, would compromise the spirit of spearing\u2014 swimming. But allowing athletes to recover from injuries consistent of sport. We should set limits, as the International Cycling Union has done, on the hermatocrit\u2026and test health, not test for drugs. It makes no difference whether an athlete\u2019s hermatocrit goes from 46 to 48 percent, by altitude training or by taking EPO or blood doping.

Don\u2019t use my name. Don\u2019t use my name. So I\u2019ll avoid the names but there are a couple things we need to know. Number one, the rules of the game say that steroids and for good reason, performance-enhancing drugs are absolutely illegal. Cheating is cheating and you can\u2019t change it, you can do it any way you want with any documentary but you can\u2019t change it. Steroids however you have to know this. They will make you faster, they will make you stronger, and they make help you look and feel and be younger. That\u2019s a lot of attraction. Steroids will make you wealthy. Steroids will make you famous. Steroids will help you get success and if you don\u2019t believe it, look at some of the guys that hold the records. During the course of my preparation I talked to a Hall of Famer. I said let me ask you something. I said with the steroids, you didn\u2019t have \u2018em when you were playing. What if there were steroids now. And he said if it got me back on the field, regardless of the penalty, I\u2019d do it. I thought man, Hall The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d of Famer, you wanna play\u2014he said you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, not to be able to excel at the game anymore. Said steroids are the greatest attraction, it\u2019s like walking on the beach with no one around, you and a beautiful girl. You know what\u2019s gonna happen. Said, well. I had to tell my wife, I can\u2019t talk about that one. However\u2026even though there is no clinical proof, let me repeat, there is no clinical proof that steroids directly lead to death, there are certain guys have suffered something, now, Lyle Alzado was mentioned. Lyle Alzado is\u2014 as\u2014Alzado is not a name to me. I knew him, I interviewed him, I liked him. Thought he was crazy, but that\u2019s why we got along. Lyle Alzado\u2026this is what\u2019s not commonly discussed, when he was a freshman in college, weighed 190 pounds. When he graduated as a senior and he started steroids in 1969 as a freshman. When he graduated it was 300-pound muscle mass. That\u2019s a gain of 110 pounds, and you knew he was going big in the NFL draft. Went on to become the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1977. Couple of weeks before he died he said, damn, if I\u2019d never done steroids and human growth hormone, I wouldn\u2019t be dying today. He died, at the age of 43. 43 years old. Ken Caminiti. He\u2019s a third baseman for the Padres, it\u2019s spring of 1996. He\u2019s chasing a fly ball, he goes out, he dives. He tears his rotator cuff. Ken Caminiti was a good guy, a tough guy, a bull of a guy. He said I gotta get well, so he played even though he was in great pain.", "The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d Said Ken. Go down to Tijuana, get you some anabolic steroids, you\u2019ll be back on the field better than ever. So he did. In the year 1996 when he got hooked on steroids and didn\u2019t just do cycles, but did double cycles, so don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re gonna monitor it. Ain\u2019t nobody gonna monitor it. He used so much steroids, that he became a giant of a man, he was bulging, Ken Caminiti went from hitting .282, to hitting .330. He went from 23 home runs to 40 home runs, he had 130 RBI\u2019s, he made millions on a free-agent contract, and, he was absolutely hooked, he said, the more I used the more I had to use, because if I didn\u2019t use I felt like I was going on the field naked. Nobody wants to walk out on a field naked. But that\u2019s how he felt. \u2018Cause he said, I was hooked. He was the MVP of baseball in 1996. Eight years later he was dead, at the age of 40. But, there\u2019s no clinical proof that steroids led to his death. Even though, he was an ala\u2014anabolic steroid type free. If any of you are Yankee fans, think back to 1999. The Yankees win the World Series. They have a relief pitcher you may or may not have heard of named Dan Naulty. You ever heard of him, Bob?", "Dan Naulty pitched for the Twins then became with the Yanks. Now follow this, in 1992 Don Naulty was six foot eight, The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate \u201cPerformance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports\u201d he\u2019s a strapping right-hander, he weighs only 165 pounds. Guy said to him, Don, you gotta get on some steroids, man, you put some body on you. So he did. In 1999 he was with the Yankees, he weighed 245 pounds. That\u2019s a weight gain of 60 pounds. And it was all muscle. Unfortunately he described himself as being suicidal, he said, \u201cI was absolutely nutso.\u201d Now he didn\u2019t die, he survived. But he had to have major surgery because his veins were clotted against his arteries. He had to have major surgery because he tore the muscle right off\u2014the, the muscle and the groin completely off the bone. Dr. James Andrews, a man I consider to be one of the foremost absolutely best surgeons of all. He said\u2014he\u2019s a north\u2014noted orthopedic surgeon, he said that\u2026now check this out. That in 2002, 17 percent\u202617 percent of total baseball payroll went to guys who were on the injured list with muscle tears, muscle strains, ruptured Achilles tendon, and on goes the list. He said that we have had a 200 percent increase in just the five years prior to 2002. Baseball owners paid $370 million to players who were not able to play. Most of them accord9ing to Dr. Andrews, were related to their use of anabolic steroids. And you now wanna admit\u2014legalize it, and govern it? No definitive clinical proof though, that it was the result of steroids. No proof.

Another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S., I'm John Donvan, we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for, and against, this motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. They go in three rounds and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. Our debaters include, on the side arguing for the motion, Glenn Hubbard, Dean of Columbia Business School and economic advisor to Mitt Romney. Your partner it Art Laffer, he is best known for the Laffer Curve, one of the main theoretical constructs of supply side economics. On the side arguing against the motion, Robert Reich, he's a professor at UC Berkeley and former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. And his partner, Mark Zandi, he's chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Our motion is this: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. Let's meet our debaters and welcome first, Glenn Hubbard.

Thank-- I'd certainly like to thank Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Center for an event on topic this important. My partner, Art Laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start. But I just want to make two points this evening.", "First, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the government that Americans have traditionally had. I'll come back to that point. Second, if we do want a larger government, and that's a political choice, the extra taxes to pay for that government will largely come from the non-rich. Now, let's start with how high tax rates are. If you look at survey data and ask Americans what they think is fair that about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid. If that's true, the current and projected marginal tax rates-- that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn-- are very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income. And, if you're New Yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, I'm leaving a lot on the table here. And 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course corporate taxes were already paid there. And, on top of that, there's an estate tax that taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone's lifetime.", "All of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income, 44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond. Now, the calls for higher tax rates really raise two concerns. First, if you step back, they treat the nation's income as an already big pie, and it doesn't really matter for the size of that pie how it's sliced. An economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes have on the decisions we all make. Those sorts of incentives would lead to lower activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes. The second choice here is that the real fiscal policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government. And here my observation isn't economics, it's just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we all will have to pay for it.", "The bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich. Now, let's start, first, on the cost of raising tax rates. Now, I can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it. And economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high. Now, some of the somethings we get less of are work and saving. And, here, I just want to offer you a forecast, and I should be honest with you that President Bush once said about me that \"Glenn can't even forecast the past.\" And I think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what it's worth. But economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates. The responses of high income tax payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other tax payers.", "Of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income. High business taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs. More than half of Americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes at individual rates. Raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring, discourages investment. If you make a comparison of next year's tax law, with higher rates, to the much bally-hooed Bowles-Simpson plan, you'd find that the lower tax rates in Bowles-Simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent. And high tax rates don't necessarily produce revenue. The fact that revenue shares and GDP haven't varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70 percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times.", "The right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for those tax payers. Now, what about the larger government? Before the financial crisis, federal spending in the U.S. averaged about 20 percent of GDP for many decades. What if we decide we'd like a bigger government? Let's say 25 percent, or maybe a larger number, like many European countries. Shouldn't raising tax rates on the rich pay for that government? Well, the simple answer is no. Or, more accurately, it can't. If you look across the OECD, the club of rich industrial nations, you'll find something that may surprise some of you. The U.S. has the most progressive tax system.", "And, in fact, the U.S. tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other country's tax system. So you think to yourself, \"Well, how can this be? We're thinking of European nations with large government and social welfare programs.\" But the answer is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there's just not that much income at the top, and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a VAT that are borne by all citizens to fund their spending. So the real choice is the size of government. That's the debate we need to have first. Taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance growth and living standards. The right tax system for this country can accomplish both. And so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax rates on high income individuals.", "If we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay.

But we're in a recovery. Look. I think this is an absurd motion, and I urge you to vote against it when you have a chance to vote against it again. It's an absurd motion for the following reasons. Number one, we have a huge budget deficit. Even if we didn't want to expand the size of government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have a gigantic budget deficit. And the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of gross domestic product. And the question is how do you get the deficit down? How do you get the debt down? Well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's got to be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts. The Simpson-Bowles commission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said, \"Well, we have one dollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts.\"But there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn't the size of government, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the tax increases. Is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who are in the middle, or is it people who are poor? And I want to tell you in terms of common sense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top. Why, why, why? You can applaud, but don't take away from my time. Why? Because number one, people at the top have never had it so good. I mean, the percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top one percent, has doubled over the past 30 years. It used to be 10 percent back in 1980. It's now over 20 percent. That is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20 percent of total income. If you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn't just double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years.", "If you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of total income over the last 30 years. The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together. And this kind of asymmetry, this kind of distorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is really something new in this country, at least within people's living memory. It wasn't this way in the '50s or '60s or '70s. It wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s. So, if we're going to have to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on the top. Now, Glenn Hubbard is talking about, \"Well, you have a negative effect, a negative incentive effect.\" Come on. In the immortal words of Joe Biden, \"Malarkey!\" mean, look. The tax rate-- the marginal tax rate on top incomes-- go back before 1981-- for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was at least 70 percent. Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist-- Bill O'Reilly would not have called him a communist-- and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomes under Eisenhower was 91 percent. If you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits, it's still-- the effective tax rate under Eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higher than anybody today is talking about. We're talking-- right now, we're talking about the difference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to Bill Clinton's days? I mean, this is a ridiculous debate. It should not even be debated obviously.", "Given where we were before and where we are now, we shouldn't even be raising this question. I mean, they will say higher taxes have a negative impact on economic growth. Well, guess what? In the three decades before 1981, when taxes were higher on the rich, the economy on average per year grew faster than it has grown since 1981. There was no negative impact on growth. I mean, George W. Bush reduces-- remember 1981-- 2001, 2003, he reduces taxes on the wealthy, saying, \"Oh, we're going to get this huge increase in growth, and we're going to get all kinds of jobs,\" using and spouting supply-side-- excuse me, Art-- nonsense-- and what did we get? We actually had less growth. We had fewer jobs, even before the great crash. We had an economy that did not perform nearly as well as it did under the president I was very proud to have served under, that is Bill Clinton, who raised taxes.", "We had the largest and longest boom in modern memory, 22 million new jobs were created. That wasn't a negative growth, that was not a slowdown in growth. We raised taxes, 22 million new jobs were created. I was secretary of labor during those times. I created every single one of those jobs. Thank you. Thank you very much. So just to-- in summary-- we have to raise taxes in order to deal with the budget deficit, regardless of what your particular ideology is about a smaller or larger government. Number two, the rich have done extraordinarily well. Everybody else hasn't. In fact, median family incomes since 2000 have actually dropped 8 percent. You want to put more taxes on average working people? No. That's simply not fair.", "It's not going to work. Number three, the rich right now bear a lower, smaller, marginal tax burden than they have at any time in the post-war era. Of course you have to raise taxes on the rich if we're going to get on with the business of this country. So please vote against this silly proposition.

You're jealous of them, and Robert may be but he's one of them. And the other thing is, you're going to get more revenue. And you're going to create prosperity. Those are the other two. And I'm going to land on the last two and look at the facts if I can. I mean, in the 30-- if you look at the growth rate there, we can go back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let's say from the Roaring '20s, we cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the Roaring '20s. It was called the \"Roaring \u201820s\" for a reason. We had enormous expansion of growth, output, and employment. The top 1 percent of income earners, now, we have great data on the top 1 percent of income earners. The IRS really likes to know how much you owe them. And we have great data. The top 1 percent of income earners, their taxes as a share of GDP soared during the period of the Roaring '20s. If you look at the 1930s, we raised the highest margin-- well, we first had May of 1930 we had the Smoot- Hawley Tariff.", "Then Hoover raised the highest tax rate on the rich from 25 percent to 63 percent. Then Roosevelt on January 1936 raised it from 63 to 79 percent and then up to 83 percent. There's a reason why it was called the Great Depression. The economy was in a shambles in large part because of the tax increases. The revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners as a share of GDP went down during this period. You look at the Kennedy period where we cut the highest tax rates from 91 percent to 70 percent. We also put in the investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation, cut the corporate rates, did tariff reform as well-- the Kennedy-run tariff negotiation, tax rate-- it was called the-- it was called the \"Go-Go '60s,\" if you remember, a boom in the economy, and tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners went up during that period as a share of GDP. We then had the four stooges, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter. Which I consider to be the largest assemblage of bipartisan ignorance probably ever put on planet Earth.", "If you look at that period, we had stagnation for 16 straight years. The stock market collapsed during that period. Tax revenues for the top 1 percent of income earners went down as a share of GDP. Then we had-- then we had Ronny-- oh, excuse me, the sky is opened, the sun shone forth on the planet, the grass turned green, the animals, they multiplied, the children danced in the street, but we cut the highest tax rates of everything we could find. We had Steiger-Hansen in '78, then we cut the-- I mean, under Reagan, cut it from 70 percent to 28 percent. If you look at the whole period from 1978 all the way to 2007, we cut the highest tax rate on earned income from 50 percent to 35 percent. We cut the highest tax rates on unearned income from 70 percent to 15 percent.", "We cut the capital gains tax rate, we cut all of these tax rates across the board. We had a boom, and it wasn't just Ronald Reagan. Robert, your president, by the way, cut the capital gains tax rate dramatically; he got rid of capital gains taxes on owner occupied homes for everyone, he also got rid of the tax on retirees working, which was the group between 65 and 72. He also put in welfare reform, he also cut gtovernment spending as a share of GDP by more than the next four best presidents combined, and he had the greatest secretary of labor of all time-- But he was a big taxer. We had huge growth during that period. If you look at what happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners-- you know, in 1980 tax revenues as share of GDP from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of GDP. By 2007, tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of GDP, it more than doubled.", "Let me tell you really honestly, you're not going to get the money from these guys.

They're in there for some reason and they find it. You know, what you really want to do is get a low rate, flat tax, where you have no exceptions, no exemptions, no deductions, none of that stuff. And get them out of the business of trying to finagle their tax codes, get them out of the business of trying to influence government, get them into a position where they create prosperity and economic growth. And that is the way you got to go.

The first, this is in no particular order of importance, but the first is, the skewing of the distribution of income consumption and wealth, and the second is our fiscal problems.", "The statistics here are pretty startling. Let's begin with the income distribution, wealth distribution. If you take the top 20 percent of income earners, they take home over 50 percent of the nation's income, the top 20 percent take home 50 percent of the income. They consume 60 percent of the total pie. So, from cars to clothing and everything in between, they consume 60 percent. And they own 90 percent of the wealth. These are pretty skewed statistics. And the more startling thing is they've gotten more skewed over the past 30 years. You know, you go back to the early 1980s, late 1970s, these statistics were very different. I'll just give you one example. I mentioned that the top 20 percent accounts for 60 percent of the spending.

There's the wars. That's $1.2 trillion over the last 10 years. That's Afghanistan and Iraq. There's the Bush era tax cuts. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that cost us $1.6 trillion over a 10 year period. And, of course, there was a recession, the great recession, and by my calculation, that's cost us about $1.8 trillion over the course of the last 10 years. You add it up, it's a lot of money. So, we've got some big problems, very significant issues we have to tackle.", "Now, the bad news is that-- it sounds pretty bad-- The bad news is that if we-- these trends will continue if policymakers don't act. If they don't act, these trends will continue, and this will harm economic growth, become very self-reinforcing in a negative way. Take the deficits. If policymakers continue on with current policy, if they don't do anything with the current tax rates, if they don't cut spending as agreed to as part of the sequestration, if they don't address the payroll tax holiday, you can go on and on and on, well, the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio is going to go from the current 70 percent-- and, by the way, it's doubled over the last 10 years from 35 to 70 percent-- it'll go over 100 percent by 2025.

Globalization-- a great recent piece in the New York Times, going over this, globalization, technological change-- these are all really very good things for our economy. We need to continue on with the process of globalization and certainly technological change improves all our lives, but clearly it affects the distribution of income and wealth.

I don't get paid as well. But, it's globalization that allows them to get these great returns, and their income and wealth rises. And I think the problem here is that if we don't address the skewing of the distribution and wealth, the disenfranchised are going to say, \"Enough!\" And they're going to stop the process of globalization, and they're going to rebel against the pace of technological change, and that's going to be to everyone's detriment, including higher income households. Now, here's the good news. We can solve this problem, and we can solve it together in a combined way. We have to think about addressing our fiscal problems through the prism of the income-- the distribution of income and wealth. So, we need to cut government spending? Absolutely. We have to do this. But, we have to do this in a way that's intelligent and maybe means-testing for entitlement programs. You know, take-- change the entitlement programs for the wealthy into insurance policies, but that only goes so far.", "We don't want to go to the point where the insurance policies become a welfare program and we lose support for things like Medicare and Social Security. That'd only take us so far. So we have to address taxes. If I were king for the day, I wouldn't raise tax rates on anybody, and I don't think we need to, right? I am all for tax reform. Let's close the deductions, let's close the loopholes, let's make the tax code fairer, broaden the base, I'm all for it, but let's use the revenue to address our fiscal problems, not to cut tax rates, until we're able to do that, right?

And if you believe, as I do and as Mark does, that the rich should bear the lion's share of that revenue raising, then you've got to, please, for the good of your children and your grandchildren-- For the good of America, as solid patriots, you have got to vote against this proposition, because it is, in its entirety, given where we are in this country right now, given the challenges we face, this proposition is simply and unalterably ludicrous."], "speaker": "Robert Reich", "nontext": {"laughterbut": [[0, 50]], "laughter": [[0, 25], [0, 44], [0, 209], [0, 252]]}}, {"speakertype": "mod", "segment": 2, "paragraphs": ["Thank you, Robert Reich."], "speaker": "John Donvan", "nontext": {}}, {"speakertype": "against", "segment": 2, "paragraphs": ["Thank you."], "speaker": "Robert Reich", "nontext": {}}, {"speakertype": "mod", "segment": 2, "paragraphs": ["Our motion is: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.

I'd ask two questions of our partners tonight. First, what evidence suggests that the economic consequences of higher tax rates on the successful could improve the employment or the income prospects of the rest? And, second, is the nation better off by raising tax rates on high income people or by balancing fairness and prosperity, asking sacrifice from the affluent through the growth consequences of tax reform, and reforming our spending programs to be a safety net? The question at hand tonight is a broad one and an important one. This country has long identified with equality of opportunity.

At first blush, tonight\u2019s motion seems like a slam-dunk for the proposers. 95 percent of the pertinent quotations I looked at were ringing supports of free speech. But there were a couple of more sardonic observations that are perhaps truer to our real attitudes. Here\u2019s Heywood Broun: \u201cEveryone favors free speech in the slack moments, when no axes are being ground.\u201d Louis B. Mayer: \u201cI respect my executives who disagree with me\u2026especially when it means losing their jobs.\u201d Well, it\u2019s amusing, but we do indeed live in a world where jobs are lost because of speech. Larry Summers, for example, lost the presidency of Harvard because of remarks offensive to women. Senator George Allen may well lose \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d his because of a highly arcane ethnic epithet. So given the heightened sensitivity of so many groups in American society to demeaning speech, we should hardly be surprised that speech offensive to Muslims elicits so strong a reaction, as appalled as we may be by the associated violence. I\u2019m now going to hand the evening over to our moderator, Jeffrey Toobin. Jeffrey is senior legal analyst for CNN Worldwide, and is staff writer at The New Yorker, where he\u2019s been covering legal affairs since 1993. He and I are both alumni of the Harvard Law School. He joined CNN from ABC News where he provided legal analysis on such high-profile cases as the Elian Gonzales custody saga, for which he received the Emmy Award.

Since World War III almost started over a bunch of cartoons, I want to thank this evening\u2019s organizers for including a cartoonist\u2014two, if you include Christopher Hitchens. 150 years ago, the Tammany Hall politician Boss Tweed responded to an offensive cartoon against him with the famous line, \u201cStop them damn pictures.\u201d The reason we\u2019re here tonight, is that these days, everyone wants to stop them damn pictures, if the damn pictures in question hurt their feelings or the feelings of their tribe. When I say everyone, I mean everyone. Early in my career, I penned this badly-drawn cartoon, \u201cFundamental Sex Ed\u2014does the stork bring AIDS and herpes too?\u201d I expected calls from the fundamentalist ministers in the area, but no, I got calls from schoolteachers saying, \u201cNot all teachers are fat, old and carry rollers!\u201d Schoolteachers aren\u2019t alone. In the course \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d of my 25 years as a paid professional offender, I have been attacked for criticizing people of color, people without much color, people of guns, people of excessive weight, people with trial lawyers, and Armenian people. This is a partial list, and certainly doesn\u2019t begin to cover people of religion, who are the touchiest people of all. Unfortunately for the pious, Americans like their damn cartoons and they always have. In nine\u2014in 1872, Joseph Keppler drew this tribute to religion, which as you can see on the lower left, offensive caricatures Jews, and on the right, offensively caricatures Catholics.", "But wait\u2014in the middle, he offensively caricatures Episcopalians, Mormons, Baptists, Presbyterians, and even Henry Ward Beecher, the New Age minister and adulterer of his age. If we had more time, I\u2019d show more cartoons. So, when newcomers arrive on our shores, with their deeply held religious beliefs, they should be prepared to get in line to have those beliefs scrutinized, as they did in the mid-1800s when New York City, like Denmark today, was awash with poor foreign immigrants who came with their robed clerics and demands for separate schools. These were of course Catholics, not Muslims, but some American cartoonists reacted just the way the Danes did. In 1871, the father of American cartoonists, Thomas Nast, drew this. \u201cThe American River Ganges.\u201d The hats of the reptilian bishops crawling ashore \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d have menacing crocodile teeth\u2014certainly the precursors of a turban as a bomb.", "Usually, my colleagues don\u2019t go out of their way to kick a clergyman. However, when the clergy ask for special privileges, demand special tax cuts, or are just especially misbehaving, we take notice. This Pat Oliphant, \u201cThe Running of the Altar Boys\u201d\u2026 You\u2019re cutting into my time, stop laughing. It was embraced by many lay Catholics, but bitterly denounced by official Catholicism. Note to church leaders\u2014if you don\u2019t want your clerics ridiculed as child abusers, make sure they don\u2019t abuse children. Had Americans been able to see the Danish cartoons, they would\u2019ve noted that they too were not just gratuitous attacks on the faithful. One was making fun of the idea that after blowing up innocent people, suicide bombers would be rewarded with virgins in Heaven. If you can\u2019t make fun of that, what can you make fun of. What really enraged believers wasn\u2019t that Mohammed was pictured but that he was pictured negatively. To test the point, at the height of the controversy I put Mohammed in this cartoon, \u201cThe Big Fat Book of Offensive Religious Cartoons.\u201d He\u2019s third from the right, flanked by Jesus and God, and a few other laughing deities. No one protested this because no one \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d cared about Mohammed being drawn as jolly and benign. However, I have been picketed without putting Mohammed in a cartoon. \u201cRadical Islam Sponsors the Miss Muslim World Contest\u2014Miss Illiteracy, Miss Can\u2019t Vote, Miss Waiting to Be Stoned.\u201d When I say picketed, I mean picketed, including\u2026 including by one of my daughter\u2019s high school history teachers.", "But Muslims aren\u2019t alone in their selective outrage. My Jewish readers were okay with the drawing with the Star of David that was pro-Israel, but roasted me for one that criticized a local Jewish senator who was attacking his opponent for being anti- Semitic. Critics said that the Star of David was off-limits\u2014 unless, apparently, it was used to make a point that they agreed with. What critics of offensive cartoons forget is that every time I exercise my free speech, my readers exercise theirs, swiftly and loudly. For that last little sketch with the Star of David, our paper received and printed weeks of vilifying letters. The Anti- Defamation League denounced me, I was called a Nazi, and the senator\u2019s son helpfully suggested to my editors how they could better use my talents.", "One reader wrote that I was worthy of Hustler magazine, which at my age I take as something of a compliment. \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d Speaking of Hustler, its publisher, Larry Flynt, is the patron saint of cartoonists. When Hustler ran a spoof claiming that Jerry Falwell\u2019s first sexual encounter was with his mother in an outhouse the right reverend Falwell did the Christian thing, and sued, in a case that went to the Supreme Court in 1987. The unanimous decision was written by that famed pinko degenerate, William Rehnquist, who wrote that \u201cEven though the spoof was outrageous, outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse is inherently subjective,\u201d and that \u201cthe court has long protected free speech, even speech that offends the audience.\u201d So the offended are left with the same option I use\u2014free speech.

I am a citizen born of the last century, one that had genocide right in its center. That century will forever color my view of the harm that human beings are capable of. Propaganda is not a parlor game and rhetoric is not recreation. Words have consequences. I take words seriously enough to make them my vocation, and I believe that some words should remain unspoken. My third claim is that I am a Constitutionalist and a civil libertarian. I believe that individuals exist prior to the state and that the state must remain accountable to its citizens. Thus I am allied with \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d my opponents in this debate in their healthy distrust of limits on speech.", "Indeed, if we had time to discuss the entire history of suppression of dissent in this country, my guess is that all six of us here on this stage would agree that the record contains many deplorable episodes. So why do I diverge on the particular question of assaultive speech and urge you to vote no tonight? It is precisely because I value speech. As I see it, there are two main reasons for the First Amendment or for our protection of speech. One is simply that we respect individual choices. Each of us is sovereign over ourselves and entitled to express the cry of our own heart. The second reason is functional. We need democracy in order for our individual selves to thrive, and we need speech in order for democracy to thrive. Democracy requires that each and every individual speak, think, study, know, and participate in self- governance.", "When hate speech and propaganda instill beliefs of inherent inferiority, the very things that the First Amendment is intended to protect are at risk. When racist invective keeps you away from a public hearing, as has happened, when sexual taunting keeps you away from a job, as has happened, democracy\u2019s prerequisites of mutual exchange and participation are gone. My students tell \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d me, you\u2019ve got to give examples, people don\u2019t understand without examples. So I\u2019ll give you one from the Asian-American community. Right after the last major San Francisco earthquake, the big one, there was a public debate about whether to rebuild certain sections of the freeway. One off-ramp in particular that led into Chinatown was of concern to the residents of that community, and they turned out for a public hearing. Well, the white Aryan Resistance also decided to do a show of force at that hearing, in their full Nazi stormtrooper regalia.", "This is pre-Internet so instead of a Web site they had a hotline you could call to hear racist invective and find out who had testified at that hearing. Many of the elders and merchants in that community would come out to testify, and it was their first experience with participation in the democratic process. They were frightened away, and were very unlikely to come out again as the debate continued around this issue of political discourse. If you think about why we disallow defamation, or impose legal penalties for it, it\u2019s because reputation is part of the self, and it\u2019s part of the self that\u2019s needed to participate equally in the democratic conversation. If you lose standing in the community you lose liberty. The freedom to move about as a respected person, to speak credibly, to join your fellow citizens in this grand social contract that we call democracy. Your reputation is \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d valuable, and thus we will restrain speech when it takes your reputation from you.", "I submit that there are forms of assaultive speech that have very much the same effect. I\u2019ve asked for 30 years why we penalize someone who calls a doctor a quack, but we won\u2019t penalize someone who says that by race, the doctor is inherently worthless and properly subject to extermination. I haven\u2019t received an answer. If you believe, as I do, that unbridled freedom to wound with words and to incite through propaganda can harm the very freedom that we intend to protect by protecting speech, then I suggest that you vote against the proposition. The other side will tell you we can\u2019t start down that path of deciding which speech is acceptable, or we become trapped in the censorship business. This is a rhetorical move that lawyers call the slippery slope.", "What the other side will not tell you is that we are already on the slippery slope of tolerating censorship of certain forms of speech, including libel, fraud, copyright infringement, conversations in restraint of trade. There is no easy and absolute way out. We do have to decide when, where, and how we will limit speech. The call of the question here uses the word \u201coffensive.\u201d But let me make clear that none of us would be engaged in this debate if we were just talking about table manners, or humorous insults with \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d political purpose, the right to offend that Signe Wilkinson is talking about. If we say that we are closing the door, taking an absolutist position, giving a free license to those who would use words to assault, we\u2019re doing much more than just allowing political cartoons, which I think should be protected absolutely, we can discern how to do that under our legal system.", "But what I\u2019m really getting at is words that are intended to wound, and to stop people from equal participation in society. If I spit on your shoe, you can sue me for that, it\u2019s called a battery. There are words I could use that would have the same effect on your psyche, your personhood, or your ability to move freely. Yet if you vote for this proposition you\u2019re saying that that form of assault is allowed. It happens in this city and elsewhere in our country.

We\u2019re faced tonight with people who want to stop cartooning but who make a caricature of the concept of free speech. They are not here to discuss free speech, they are here to discuss their deep conviction that speech is not free and therefore should not be free. That is essentially what the previous speaker said, she said there is no free speech, let\u2019s be real, and therefore there should be no free speech and we should simply start restricting it endlessly. Since we are being cartooned as the monstrous side, let me begin with a monstrous image. In Northern Uganda for the last 15 to 20 years, there has been a movement known as the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army. It practices its warfare in the name of God, and what it does when it dislikes the speech that is being made is that it cuts off the lips of the citizens who are speaking and it puts padlocks through punctured holes in their lips and shuts them. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m very much unable to picture these people doing that, but it\u2019s very clear to me that that is what they wish to do. I will return to this image at the end, but that is the image that clearly you must bear in mind as you, the jury tonight, vote on the question of whether we shall be permitted to speak or whether we shall be inclined to silence anybody in whom we find offense. \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d That is what they are saying, and who are they to judge what is offensive? Surely you have different ideas, surely we all have different ideas, and yet somehow, the concept of offense is being proposed by the other side as some sort of universal measure of civilization rather than the opposite. But one point of agreement that we have is that speech is fiercely powerful, and can be intensely dangerous. I spent some time reporting from Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide there. The previous speaker referred to genocide, and one of the most striking things in Rwanda is that in a great deal of the genocide was incited by public speech, radio speech, incitement through words. The words were used as hate speech, which we will find the other side thinks should be censored because it is dangerous. The hate speech said, invariably, kill the minority, the Tutsis. They didn\u2019t always say it directly, they would use euphemisms and the euphemisms would be phrases like \u201cDo your work. Clear the bush. Do not let a weed escape the blade.\u201d These were phrases that were well understood in the historical context and they were clearly hate speech, there\u2019s no ambiguity about it. Those people have been tried and convicted for inciting mass murder in their country. The problem there was not free speech for haters. It was that this was the officially sanctioned \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d speech by people who prohibited sanity from being free speech. Anybody who protested against the genocide was silenced as offensive. Offensive speech, my goodness. That Hutus and Tutsis should live side by side in comity, that they should allow each other to exist\u2014how offensive. Let\u2019s silence them. Let\u2019s murder them. Let us have official speech. That was the position.", "That is the position which\u2014yes, ma\u2019am. \u201cSlippery slope.\u201d It\u2019s not a slippery slope, it\u2019s a greased precipice over which they wish to push you. Once you start to say that racist or blasphemous speech is somehow or other offensive, you\u2019re immediately on the quick descent towards book-burning. The books that you wish to burn are the books that include, let\u2019s say, Huck Finn, where racists are used in possibly the 19th century\u2019s noblest portrait of a black man in America. Blasphemous speech is used by Ahab. Most people who are burning books are of course too illiterate to notice. But let\u2019s focus on the facts. They consistently elevate idiotic speech, like Holocaust denial, to a greatly important role by saying, lets us illegalize it, challenge it in courts, give these people a tremendous platform, and prove that they\u2019re wrong\u2026when no sane person can possibly suspect that this is serious history.", "So we\u2019re going to have to elevate them in order to silence them, \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d rather than to ignore them, to discuss it with them. I would like to quote to you a short passage from David Cesarani in which he wrote, \u201cCelebrating Austria\u2019s Law Criminalizing Holocaust Denial.\u201d This was in The Guardian. \u201cThanks to the Internet,\u201d he claims, \u201cit is virtually impossible to stop the dissemination of laws and propaganda these days. The classical arguments of freedom of speech drawn from Voltaire and Mill are redundant.\u201d So we have an anti-enlightenment argument very strongly stated. \u201cThey addressed small, literate elites at a time when the means of reproduction were relatively few and easily controlled, when it was easy to contend that in a contest between truth and falsehood held among reasonable men, lies would be exposed and driven from the public sphere.", "But the Internet is awash with falsehood and bigotry. Good ideas and beautiful truths coexist with trash and outright evil. Heaven forfend that bad ideas should be out there. Amid this anarchy,\u201d he says, \u201call that decent people can do is agree to reasonable limits on what can be said and set down legal markers in an attempt to preserve a democratic, civilized and tolerant society.\u201d That\u2019s what he says. I say, who gives him the right to set up a chair in the antechambers of my mind and judge what I\u2019m allowed to say and what I\u2019m allowed to think. Is that what you want? Is that who you want? How does it avail the \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d cause of civilization, sir, to fight brownshirts with brownshirt tactics? I would like to know that. What I share with this pious trinity of the opposing team is a deeply pessimistic view of human history. I do not believe that if you let people run around loose they\u2019re going to have nice ideas about each other and behave nicely towards each other, because that\u2019s not what they do.", "Their response is to cut off their lips and to clamp on a padlock. To decide who should be in the Sanhedrin of the mind and who should be in the Sanhedrin of the soul, sit around and tell you what you\u2019re allowed to say and what you\u2019re allowed to think. They do not understand that there is not agreement about this. They seem to assume that somehow or other it will always prevail. Yes, they say times change, sometimes it\u2019s allowed to be racist, sometimes it\u2019s allowed to be anti-racist. Sometimes we silence the people who are pro-Jewish, sometimes we silence the people who are anti-Muslim, but that\u2019s okay because we\u2019re just rolling with the times, and we\u2019re always going to let the people who we sort of think are civilized speak in the name of civility.", "I think that this is extremely dangerous. I return, that while they conclude that we must accept that because speech is limited we must put ourselves in charge of limiting it, that we are dealing here really with a case of lesser evils. The question before us \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d tonight, simply put and simply stated in the proposition that we were given, is that freedom of speech must include a license to offend. I would expand that license to blaspheme, and I would not call it a license. They speak of it as a license, they think all speech is a license and that all speech should be licensed because most speech should be restricted before it is licensed. Then we decide, okay, we\u2019ll let this out, we\u2019ll let that out, we\u2019ll let this out, we\u2019ll let that out. I think that that\u2019s a very, very, very dangerous precipice on which they want to perch us. I do not trust them, even though I think that they\u2019re probably more trustable than most.", "But what is to say that they will stay in charge of that speech? What is to say that we will not fall into the hands of somebody we don\u2019t trust? What is to say that the message that one day seems somewhat sane, the next day becomes to kill, and that the people who say let us not kill are silenced in the name of reasonable speech and in the name of civilization to moderate that.

Well\u2014 First of all I want to thank Philip for repeating verbatim something I wrote in The Guardian. I stand by every word, and it\u2019s saved me a bit of time. I do think it is possible for reasonable people, like the people in this room, to decide what is offensive and what is dangerous. Mari, in a very modest and less flamboyant way, tried to set out what it is that is offensive, and what is dangerous. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really necessary to bother to respond to a very foolish idea of what this side of the house is advocating. We are not advocating cutting off people\u2019s lips, we are not even advocating repealing the First Amendment. We\u2019re not even advocating special laws that will have people banged up in prison for saying things that we don\u2019t like. We\u2019re just asking you, and I\u2019m asking this as someone who\u2019s British, to just reflect with a little humility on American society and culture. To reflect while holding in mind the fact that, in most other liberal democracies, there are modest constraints on what can be said and written. For good reason, too. Most international conventions that set out freedoms also include constraints on the freedom of expression, most notably the European Convention on Human Rights.", "The reason is that the European Convention on Human Rights \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d that was passed in 1950 was framed against the background of genocide, mass murder, persecution, and totalitarianism in Europe. Men and women had seen the drip-drip effect there of hate speech, words that demeaned and degraded, and resolved that freedom of speech could no longer be considered an absolute right. It was a right, a fundamental element of liberty. But it was not absolutely overriding because it was open to abuse. It was abused in Europe, it\u2019s abused now, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s actually abused here. Philip Gourevitch said rather mockingly that we came to you to ask you to get real. I\u2019m going to repeat that. Get real. There was a little article in The Guardian which amused me. Apparently, a few days ago, a meeting to be addressed by a colleague of mine, Tony Judd, a historian who I rate enormously highly, was canceled because of a phone call from Abe Foxman.", "I don\u2019t know if Abe Foxman is in this audience now, but he\u2019s obviously a very powerful man. Just with the one of his voice he can have meetings canceled and freedom of expression curtailed. I think that is an abuse of power. I think that it is very dangerous that people can phone up organizations and have meetings canceled because they don\u2019t like, not what the speaker is actually going to address, but other things that he has spoken about. Tony Judd has written some things about Israel that Abe didn\u2019t like, so Abe phoned up the Polish consulate and said, do \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d you really want to have that guy speak on your premises? Now, get real. You have constraints on freedom of expression in this great country. What we are asking you to do is to reflect with a little bit of humility on how you want those constraints to be exercised by the most powerful, the most ruthless, the ones with the biggest bank balances, the ones with the most votes.", "Or do you want to have a public debate about how you protect those who are weak, who are vulnerable, who are defenseless, who are marginal, and who are often abused in the mass media or in work settings, as Mari mentioned. I think the real choice is not whether you\u2019re in favor of absolute freedom of speech or constraints on freedom of speech tonight. It\u2019s whether you\u2019re going to be realistic, or whether you\u2019re going to be smug and hypocritical and walk out of this hall thinking this is the land of the free, land of the brave, no such things as restrictions on freedom of speech here, and we don\u2019t want to be lectured about that by some limey. Whether you\u2019re going to recite to yourselves happily, Milton, Locke, Mill!\u2014 without actually knowing very much about what Milton, Locke and Mill had to say about freedom of expression. For none of these men was freedom of expression a good in itself. It was always a means to an end.", "For Milton, who didn\u2019t like Catholics, it was to expose the fallacies \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d of Catholicism prior to crushing and eradicating them. For Locke, it was simply a means to good governments. For Mill, it was to advance education and truth. As soon as Mill considered the possibility of uneducated mass audiences, he panicked and resiled. He went back on everything that he\u2019d said about unlimited freedom of speech. I\u2019m going to read out what John Stuart Mill had to say. \u201cActs of whatever kind, which without justifiable cause do harm to others, may be\u2014and, in the more important cases, absolutely require to be\u2014controlled by the unfavorable sentiments and when needful by the active interference of mankind.\u201d He included speech acts, and the notorious, wonderful example he gave is the folly of allowing a man in a time of famine to inveigh against grain dealers outside the home of a grain dealer before a public that is hungry, ill-educated, and not terribly reasonable. That unfortunately is the state of our society today. There are a lot of people who are unreasonable, who are ill- educated, who are angry about this and that, and there are plenty of people who want to stir the pot and who want to incite them. John Stuart Mill, who understood the perils of mass society, also understood that we are no longer conducting this discussion amongst a nice, homogeneous elite, but we are having to deal with huge numbers of people in divided, conflicted \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d societies. I think\u2014and I\u2019m an optimist, unlike Philip Gourevitch\u2014that we have it within our power, thinking and working together, to agree on what can and cannot be said, should and should not be said, to avoid conflict, to avoid people standing outside the homes of grain merchants, and inveighing against their business.", "This is what Timothy Garton Ashe wrote recently in The Guardian. \u201cWe need to wake up to the seriousness of the danger\u201d\u2014the danger to freedom of speech, freedom of expression. \u201cI repeat, this is one of the greatest challenges to freedom in our time. We need a debate about what the law should and should not allow to be said or written. Even Mill did not suggest that everyone should be allowed to say anything anytime anywhere. We also need a debate about what it\u2019s prudent and wise to say in a globalized world where people of different cultures live so close together, like roommates separated only by a thin curtain. There is a frontier of prudence and wisdom which lies beyond the one that should be enforced by law.\u201d We are, on this side of the house, advocating that you think about where that boundary of prudence and wisdom should lie.

If you remember the appalling judgment actually rendered by Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in that case, he was comparing the action that I\u2019ve just imitated and parodied to the action of a group of Yiddish-speaking socialists who gave out a leaflet, in Yiddish only, opposing Mr. Wilson\u2019s war and actually calling attention as they were to a major conflagration raging in Europe in which they did not think the United States should become involved.", "Be very, very, very careful when people give you arguments from authority or tradition that suggest that free speech can be limited by higher authorities like the sainted Holmes, because that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get. The end of it is a group of Yiddish-speaking radicals told they can\u2019t hand out a leaflet in Yiddish on a major question of the day.

My \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d favorite crowded-theater story is actually about the terrible Broadway production of The Diary of Anne Frank. Some people may remember this, it\u2019s a production famous for its longueurs. In the third act as the German soldiers came pounding on the door and stamping into the parlor, someone in the front row shouted, \u201cShe\u2019s in the attic!\u201d Call me old-fashioned if you will, ladies and gentlemen, but as you will see I don\u2019t think a joke is really a joke unless it\u2019s at somebody\u2019s expense.", "Now if you\u2019re thick-skinned and broad-backed enough to take that, I might have a bit more for you. The real question, utterly, utterly dodged by David in his shady remarks, is this. Who\u2019s going to decide. We\u2019ve already found that Oliver Wendell Holmes isn\u2019t competent on the point. Who will you appoint. Who will be the one who says, I know exactly where the limits should be, I know how far you can go and I know when you\u2019ve gone too far, and I\u2019ll decide that. Who do you think\u2014who do you know\u2014who have you heard of, who have you read about in history to whom you\u2019d give that job? I always say, just for this evening, I wouldn\u2019t give it to anyone who\u2019s spoken so far on the other side. Now, I sure do know a bit about Milton and quite a lot about Thomas Paine as well. Mr. Paine actually updated and I think improved John Milton\u2019s Areopagitica which is the classic \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d case for free expression.", "Those of you who know Areopagitica and Paine\u2019s commentary on it will know that it recommends free speech in this way\u2014not for you, but for the people you are listening to and the people whose comments you hope to hear in return, for your own education, for your own enlightenment and for your own elucidation. As Mr. Paine says, commenting on Milton, one of the vices of those who would repress the opinions of others is they make themselves prisoners of their own opinions, because they deny themselves the rights and the means of changing them. Should this not be as plain as could be? The free interplay of ideas is not something that those of us who wish to speak or unload our opinions insist upon for that sake, it\u2019s because we want to hear what is said in response, however unwelcome it may be to us.", "Thus the defense of any one opinion or form of expression is a defense of all of them. The classic statement in modern times of this, in my view, would be Aryeh Neier\u2019s book Defending My Enemy where he describes the decision of the American Civil Liberties Union, of which I am a supporter, to take the case of the American Nazi Party and its right to parade swastikas through the town of Skokie, Illinois, a favorite retirement community for those who\u2019d survived the final solution. The ACLU lost a lot of \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d members on that proposition but we did the right thing by the First Amendment. In the book he has a wonderful extract from Robert Bolt\u2019s play A Man for All Seasons which some of you will have seen at least in celluloid form, where if you recall, Sir Thomas More is talking to one of the witch-hunters and prosecutors.", "He says, \u201cSo you\u2019d cut a road through the laws, would you, to get after the Devil?\u201d The witch-hunter and prosecutor says, \u201cI\u2019d cut down every law in England to do that.\u201d Thomas More says, \u201cThat\u2019s worth knowing. And when the Devil turned round to meet you and had you at bay, where would you look for shelter, Mr. Prosecutor, the laws all being flat and cut down? Where would you turn then?\u201d It\u2019s impossible ever to think of infringing the right of anyone else to free speech without arranging, in a sense calling in advance for this to happen to you too. It\u2019s quite different, obviously different, from any question of information. Information may be classified and information may be copyrighted. Every word said on that score by the first speaker on the other side was a complete waste of her breath, because it\u2019s not what we\u2019re meant to talk about. We\u2019re meant to talk about the expression of opinion and conviction, not breach of copyright or leaking of classified information. If we\u2019d wanted to talk about that, we would\u2019ve phrased the motion differently. \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d There\u2019ve been some bad signs lately, a lot of slippage in what I would have thought was the pedantic obviousness of the points I\u2019ve just made. The imprisonment of David Irving in Austria for a thought crime, for the possibility that he might while in Austria have given a speech saying that he doubts some of the verdicts of history on what I call the final solution. There\u2019s no victim to this crime. The Austrian consul called me up weeping with self-pity when I pointed this out in The Wall Street Journal and said, \u201cBut we thought finally Austria would be popular. We had something that you would all like! So gut muttlich.\u201d That the land that survives on the myth that Hitler was German and Beethoven was Viennese, that had Waldheim as its chancellor and has Jorg Heider as a member of its government, can revenge itself on a defenseless British academic and jail him is a standing disgrace.", "There are attempts to extend similar thought-crime laws to other topics of historical importance, the most depressing of which recently is the provisional decision of the French parliament to criminalize discussion of the Armenian massacre, considered by me and most others to have been a planned genocide in the early part of the 20th century. Now you couldn\u2019t take the contrary view. You couldn\u2019t for example argue, as you can, that actually in the \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d provinces of Turkey where Russian forces were not engaged, Armenians were not massacred. In other words, it could be that it was partly an act of war as well as an act of ethnocide. Speculations of this kind would now be actually in peril. The law on which it\u2019s modeled, the Loi Gayssot, which criminalizes in France discussion of the Holocaust as well, is named for the French Stalinist, Monsieur Gayssot, who sponsored it and whose spirit, and the spirit of whose hero is present in all of these and other such discussions.", "I stipulate that all of these things, when they happen, offend me very much. I\u2019m offended by them, I want you to understand. It goes to the core of what I do and what I am. The First Amendment doesn\u2019t just provide me with a living, the First Amendment is my life.

First of all, I think it was divine intervention that Christopher was not allowed to continue. I think Christopher should nominate me to decide who will decide, because really, Christopher, I\u2019m quite fair. I definitely do not believe in cutting off lips, and I hate padlocks. So I want to begin by saying that the motion of today, where the freedom of expression must include the license to offend, is in a sense really a moot point and a moot question. I hope that all of you here today will consider rejecting and throwing it out.", "The freedom we have to express ourselves does in fact enable us to offend. Christopher is doing it all the time, in his own sweet way. In fact, one can even say that sometimes it is necessary to offend, and for good cause. The appropriate question to ask today is whether freedom of expression is absolute and limitless, \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d or should it come with some social responsibility. In the US we do have a value system that undergirds our free speech. Salient within the system is the value of fighting the suppression of truth. Let\u2019s face it. The reason why we\u2019re having this debate today, is because a number of recent events, such as the Danish cartoon and Pope Benedict\u2019s remarks on Islam, have brought this issue to the forefront.", "I\u2019m mentioning these examples to frame the current affairs context for our discussion here today. There is no doubt in my mind that there are many issues, many suppressed truths, particularly within the Muslim world, that very badly need to be brought to light. I do not need to go through the litany of problems faced, for instance, by women in various parts of the Muslim world and the rest of the global South, all of which need to be discussed. There\u2019s also no doubt in my mind that when it comes to religion, Muslims need to engage in a very honest and open discussion about many of the values that they espouse. Whether they are in accordance with the teachings of Islam is another matter entirely. There are, however, certain kinds of speech that undermine the very values that liberty of expression is meant to advance. Take for example the infamous Danish cartoon protest. \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d To put it into context, we live in an environment\u2014and this is especially true of Europe\u2014where Muslims constantly face xenophobia. While the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Muslims do not partake in any violent actions in response to these political cartoons, a tiny, minuscule minority has grabbed the world\u2019s attention and apparently now has absolute command of how Muslims are to be perceived. This is coupled with a time when a new generation of European-born Muslims have emerged that routinely face discrimination, alienation, and are often perceived as threats in their own countries. And all this while the violence in Iraq continues to surpass its already shocking levels. Clearly, we\u2019re living in a very tense time. In such a situation, for a right-of-center Danish newspaper to come out with cartoons that show the prophet of Islam with a bomb in his turban, with a sword in his hand, and with a menacing look on his face does nothing, absolutely nothing, to advance desperately needed dialogue, or enlighten people in any positive way.", "If it does anything at all, it serves to suppress constructive dialogue by fueling extremist sentiments. It is important to note that this example has little to do with religion, though I think Philip and Christopher would probably tell you that\u2019s the case. This isn\u2019t about drawing the prophet, for which there are many \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d historical precedents in traditional Muslim art. To see the situation clearly, we must all understand nuance. That\u2019s what intellectuals are here for\u2014for nuance, for teaching us the nuance. My Jewish rabbi friend called me right after the cartoon crisis and said, \u201cWhat are you doing about the cartoons?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are we going to do? It\u2019s just a cartoon.\u201d He said, \u201cNo. Don\u2019t ever accept it. This is what they did to us in Germany. They started with the cartoons\u201d\u2014", "So when you publish cartoons which of course are a form of entertainment and hence immensely popular\u2014and Signe, I loved that cartoon of the radical Islam contest\u2014as a medium for conveying a particular message, or a speech is given by a person of immense power like the Pope, which further drives people apart and cements stereotypes, you\u2019re using public discourse to malign the way an already marginalized community is perceived. This, my friends, is not in accordance with our foundational values of free speech. This is un-American. The point is not whether such things can or cannot be published. But of course, they are published. Who\u2019s preventing them? The issue is whether there\u2019s any wisdom in showing the prophet of Islam with a bomb in his turban no less. This is the sort of thing that furthers that familiar, yet dangerous and unsound argument, some Muslim men are terrorists, therefore, all or even most Muslim men are terrorists. Now this last statement is certainly something we can say, something that is enshrined in free speech. But is it true? Is it responsible? Does it elevate the public discourse? Or is it simply racist, xenophobic drivel, that isn\u2019t half as clever as it purports to be?", "There are a few additional things to say. While modern \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d technology has allowed us to improve our communication, it also means that ideas, news and statements can be disseminated at a global level very rapidly. The upshot is that the global distance is of little relevance in assessing how close we are to each other. So the notion of space, of sharing space with our neighbors, needs to be negotiated and reexamined. What is needed now is a heightened sense of awareness that enables us to distinguish between useful and useless affronts. Truly, few things are more useless than statements that exasperate bigotry and racism. Finally, in keeping with my previous point, I want to make a point about individual psychology in various societies. We\u2019re always shocked at how people in the global South react vociferously, especially my people, Muslims, and at times violently, to what we see as simple free speech which may or may not undermine their value system.", "What we do not realize in our dismay is that in societies where the basics are not guaranteed, where one life, liberty, property, and family are not protected, individuals deal with disparities by developing a greater collective consciousness, where one identifies strongly with a larger community, in our case the Uma, and the collective values it represents. Something that is perceived to threaten or undermine those values are resolved not an individual level, but are resolved in a group dynamic which can sometimes \u201cFreedom of expression must include the license to offend\u201d result in chaotic mob reaction, which you\u2019re all familiar with.

Uh, on my behalf and on behalf of Dana Wolfe our executive producer it\u2019s a pleasure to welcome you. Well, our debate tonight is, in our minds anyway in the context of admissions to our elite universities and graduate schools: Is it time to end affirmative action? Our topic tonight seems on the face of it ideological. Uh, liberals feel it\u2019s\u2014affirmative action is needed to, uh, create opportunities for blacks and Hispanics and to meet a societal need, uh, for racial diversity in the universities, and in leadership positions thereafter. Conservatives believe that color-blindness is a bedrock Constitutional principle. We see the issue as more nuanced. Let me focus exclusively on what might be considered conservative ideas to\u2014 to show why. The conservative case against affirmative action includes these elements. First, affirmative action is a euphemism for admitting blacks and Hispanics to selective universities, despite wide gaps in SAT scores and grades. Discriminating on the basis of race is inherently unfair and offensive, particularly when it\u2019s done by governments. The beneficiaries of affirmative action are not the truly disadvantaged, they are mostly middle-class. The legal framework around affirmative action offers no coherent rationale, and no clear guidelines to acceptable conduct. So, that\u2019s the, uh, the conservative case. But there\u2019s a conservative case for affirmative action as well. And it\u2019s grounded in the ideas of free association, choice, and competition. Our elite universities compete with one another vigorously, for students, for faculty, for contributions, research funds, and most fundamentally, for the prestige and influence of producing future leaders. Their mission is not fulfilled simply by admitting candidates with the highest grades. Instead they routinely favor athletes, creative artists, students from poor families and unusual geographies, black and Hispanic applicants, as well as children of generous alumni. They must recognize that overweighting these elements in their portfolio of admitted students, underweights other elements, and most obviously Asian students with a predilection for the sciences. So either the portfolio of admitted students is optimal, or, competition with\u2014among universities will correct it. Politicians or courts or voters for that matter, have little useful to contribute. So our debate tonight is, it\u2019s time to end affirmative action, and that goes to the merits of the matter. But in listening to the facts and, uh, arguments marshaled by our panelists this evening, you might wanna keep in mind the question, time for whom.

Hoo, boy. Feel like I did before my first love scene with Halle Berry, so, you can\u2014 imagine, if you have any imagination at all the butterflies, and actually the excitement. Uh, because I\u2019m here in defense of what I think is one of the, uh, cornerstones of our republic, that of non- discrimination. And I think it was articulated in Brown vs. the Board of Education when, decided that discrimination in our public schools was unconstitutional, became part of our cultural lexicon a few years later when Presidents Kennedy and Johnson issued an executive order, that stately clearly and unambiguously, that, affirmative action should be taken to ensure that hiring, uh, decisions were made without regard to race. And then of course it was given teeth in the law, uh, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was very clear, that, uh, discrimination based on race was unlawful. And, uh, to quote, uh\u2026an \u201880s sitcom, uh, it\u2019s a different world from where ya come from. That was then, that was good old-fashioned non- discrimination, and it was good for America. Well times have changed, and what we\u2019re talking about now, affirmative action is no longer about non-discrimination, it\u2019s about racial preferences. And that is what we oppose\u2014racial preferences. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that we believe that racism has suddenly disappeared. It hasn\u2019t. We know that racism exists. Listen. I\u2019m 45 years old. I\u2019ve been black in America for a long time. I have seen racism, I have been the victim of racism, I\u2019m not about to stand up here and pretend, that it doesn\u2019t exist. But the question before us is not, does racism exist, the question is, are racial preferences an effective means to combat racism. And the answer is simply no. There isn\u2019t any evidence at all, that racial preferences actually benefits us in terms of our race relations, in fact, what evidence there is points to just the opposite. What we do know, is that racial preferences tend to, to en\u2014enhance, and, and firm up negative stereotypes, particularly as it pertains to black intellectual capacity and academic capabilities. Um\u2026 You know\u2026there was a saying that my mother had. And I hear it in my head right now. There is no monopoly on brain power. That\u2019s what my mother said all the time, there is no monopoly on brain power, black people can compete, we can compete on the athletic field, we can compete in the symphony halls, and we can compete in the classrooms. And what\u2019s more, my mother said, you can compete, and you will compete. But there are some folks who, sadly, are gonna tell my children something very different. And you don\u2019t have to take my word for it, let\u2019s just look at what they say. Richard Atkinson, former president of the University of California at Berkeley, standing before an audience similar to this, at University of San Diego, said that it was highly doubtful if not impossible that we would achieve diversity on our nation\u2019s premiere campuses without the use of racial preferences. Now Atkinson was not standing before a curious world, telling everybody he\u2019s just a big fat racist, and unless you rein me in I\u2019m gonna start discriminating right and left! No. What he was saying is that there is a monopoly on brain power, and that black students don\u2019t have it in sufficient quantity to show up in significant numbers in our nation\u2019s campuses. Now if you\u2019re not sufficiently\u2026offended, as you should be, let\u2019s take something else that you often hear in discussions like this. Someone, maybe here or over here, is bound to stand up and say whoa! I benefited from affirmative action. You benefited from affirmative action, she benefited from affirmative action. And of course, they\u2019re not saying, well, you benefited from non-discrimination. Well I did and that\u2019s a good thing. What they\u2019re saying is, I couldn\u2019t qualify, you couldn\u2019t qualify, she couldn\u2019t qualify\u2026 Absurd. Miss Krimberle Crenshaw there. I\u2019ve met her for the first time, I\u2019ve read what she\u2019s written, I\u2019ve heard her on the radio, this is a smart, dynamic woman. The idea, that but for racial preferences, Miss Crenshaw would be standing on the corner singing doo wop someplace is offensive to me, and it should be offensive to all in the sound of my voice. Now, you\u2019re gonna hear a lotta statistics today, I\u2019m not gonna talk to you about statistics. I\u2019m gonna talk to you about people, because racial preferences impact and affect people. This past April, spring, my wife was at a birthday party with our, with our children. And\u2026the mothers are sitting there talking, the fathers in there, you know, that, you tend to avoid these things like the plague so I wasn\u2019t there. Uh\u2026but the mothers are grouped and they\u2019re talking about their children, where they go to school and it comes to light, that my oldest boy attends a magnet program, uh, for highly gifted students. Without missing a beat\u2026one of the other mothers says, well, you know, now, with this Supreme Court decision they won\u2019t be able to accept, uh, kids in these programs for diversity. Well, my wife was kinder than I would have been. After she picked her jaw up off the floor she explained to the woman, look. He\u2019s not in this program because he checked some box. You can\u2019t get in this program unless you score 99.9 percent on the test. Let me repeat that\u201499.9 percent on the test. And, he\u2019s making straight A\u2019s. In this program. And what is more ironic, is that the woman she was talking to, is a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District. That\u2026is the evil of racial preferences. That, is the real-life impact of racial preferences. Teachers, who lack faith in the academic abilities of their students, and children, who no matter how hard they work, no matter how\u2026how broad their gifts\u2026 are stained with preference. With, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, benefi\u2014fishi\u2014fishishence.

You know, it always amazes me, to hear critics of affirmative action speak about this subject, as if racial preference were something that were invented in the \u201860s, to benefit people of color. Because in fact whether we wish to acknowledge it or not and of course we don\u2019t, the entire history of this country is the history of affirmative action for white folks like myself. And unless we begin by discussing that affirmative action, and the impact that it has had we engage in a discussion that is both ethically and practically irresponsible. Contrary to what Joseph tells you this debate is about the extent to which racism still exists because it in\u2014 is indeed the existence of that racism which necessitated affirmative action in the beginning, and continues to necessitate it today. Whether we wish to acknowledge it or not, enslavement, Indian genocide, segregation, did not only oppress people of color, they elevated white folks, and provided us with opportunities that we did not in fact earn. The Homestead Act allowed whites to claim over 270 million acres of land for virtually nothing down, at a time when folks of color could not, today there are 40 million white folks descended directly from those, who received that land giveaway, millions of them, still living on the property, they owe their lives to affirmative action. Then there was the FHA home-loan program which for the first 30 years of its existence, operated in a whites- only fashion, lending over $120 billion worth of government- backed housing equity to whites, thereby creating the white middle class. And in large measure because of those preferences, the typical black college couple, college-degreed couple starts out with less than one-fifth the net worth of a typical young white couple because the latter of those, has likely received the benefits of their family\u2019s prior head start while the former, are likely to have accumulated far less having had less chance to do so. So against that backdrop, ending affirmative action would only further cement the systemic advantages for whites that have been in place for hundreds of years, it would be tantamount to favoring those three laps ahead in a five-lap race even though those are ahead gained their head start as the result of an unfair process, but even worse, to end affirmative action would ignore the ongoing reality, not past, but ongoing reality, of white racial preference, and not only in education, but also in employment, and let me clarify, we were not told that our remarks tonight had to focus only on higher education. That resolution doesn\u2019t mention higher education, I will not speak of it only with regard to schools. Because it is not only there that it matters. According to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, three out of four companies covered by affirmative action regulations violate them regularly, and not just that, but are also in violation of basic civil rights law. The problem is the OFCCP only has enough monitors to check up on the companies under their purview once every 46 years. So there\u2019s no deterrent. But those who would end affirmative action never call for beefing up civil rights enforcement, indeed, though his teammates might not know it, Mr. Pell\u2019s organization advocates abolishing anti- discrimination law altogether, as it regards the private sector, so, Joseph can sing the praises of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but the man sitting next to him, would get rid of it as it regards private organizations, so to endorse the resolution would only intensify the problem of discrimination, those who would end affirmative action ignore the study, recent study, which found that job applicants with white-sounding names have a 50 percent greater chance of getting a call-back for an interview than those with black-sounding names even when qualifications are indistinguishable. They ignore, not only that, but the research which has found that eight in 10 jobs are never advertised, instead they\u2019re filled by networking, a process that mostly excludes people of color and women of all colors and elevates whites and men not because we are better for certain jobs but because we know the right people, and if affirmative action none of that would change for the better\u2026if anything it would get worse, the same is true for schooling. Our opponents will rail against so-called preferences of students of color while they ignore the preferences built in for whites. So they condemn the University of Michigan for giving 20 points on a 150-point scale to students of color but they ignored the points that were in practice, essentially for whites only. Like the 16 points you got, if you were from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The snow is not the only thing white there. The 10 points, just because you went to a top high school which means your parents live in the right zip code. The eight points for taking advanced- placement classes, which are three times more available in schools serving white kids than kids that serve mostly students of color or the four points you got if Daddy went to Michigan. They rally behind Jennifer Gratz, as the supposed victim of reverse discrimination because the year she was rejected, there were about 85 students of color who got into the Michigan despite having lower scores and grades but they say nothing about the 1400\u2014let me repeat\u2014 1400 white students with lower grades and lower scores than Jenny Gratz, who got in. You see, less-qualified white people are no problem, but less-qualified people of color, my goodness, we can\u2019t have that. They say nothing about the study from six weeks ago which found that for every one student of color, who receives any benefit from affirmative action in college there are at least two whites, for every one person of color two whites, who also didn\u2019t meet the requirements but got in because Daddy wrote a check, or Mama made a phone call, or somebody pulled strings and got them in, but affirmative action for rich white people is never a problem for the folks like our opponents. While they insist affirmative action is racist because it holds people of color to lower standards the fact is, it is whites who have held to lower standards, it is whites and only whites I would suggest who can get C\u2019s all the way through school, brag about their mediocrity publicly, mangle the English language, and go on to become Presidents of the United States. So, when they lament the supposed damage done to student of color by affirmative action because it supposedly forces them to question their abilities, ask yourself, why no concern for the mental health and self-image of white Americans, who have being preferred for 400 years, and if their argument is correct, must be the most self-hating people on the face of Planet Earth. And no, affirmative action doesn\u2019t place people of color in positions for which they\u2019re unqualified, indeed, once we control for economic status comparing only whites and folks of color from families with both the same income and wealth profile, there is no difference in college graduation rates, and only an insignificant difference in college grades. And black students at the most selective schools, actually do better in relation to their white counterparts than those in less-selective schools. Furthermore according to 200 different studies on the subject\u2014not just one that I\u2019m pulling out of my ass but 200 different studies\u2014employees who have benefited from affirmative action perform equal to or better than their white male counterparts once given a chance to improve themselves, so in closing, unless our opponents can show you that they have some alternative mechanism for addressing that legacy of white racial preference\u2014", "\u2014and the ongoing advantages extended to whites in this country, unless they can demonstrate some alternative means, by which true equal opportunity to flourish to vote for them, and to vote for ending affirmative action is to engage in an act of irresponsible racial aggression.

I personally would find nothing problematic with that policy, I don\u2019t think most people would. And to the extent that it is generally implied, generally via omission, that that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about racial preferences and that we\u2019re not talking about qualifications or test scores, or things that we don\u2019t wanna talk about\u2014 then it\u2019s understandable that there reigns a sense that, to be opposed to these racial preference policies means that a person must be na\u00efve or unfeeling or have a sinister agenda or something like that, all of that is, is perfectly, perfectly understandable.

But, those words also have a kind of rhetorical power that I think distracts us from the actual logic of the case here, and what racial justice is, that is how we actually solve the problems that I think we\u2019re all concerned with. And\u2026from what I\u2019ve seen over my years in discussing this question, there are certain basic facts about how racial preferences are played out, that were not often told, I don\u2019t think that people who think differently than me are willfully ignoring these things, I think these things just don\u2019t get out there very much but they are absolutely crucial, to evaluating this particular case, and in my remaining seven minutes and about 13 seconds I just wanna give you a few of those things, for one thing, affirmative action, racial preferences as we\u2019re talking about, is not just a tie-breaker. If that\u2019s really all this debate has been about, I never would\u2019ve joined it. There are all sorts of things. In 1991, in terms of all of the students who were admitted to selective law schools, um, there were 420 black ones, 24 were admitted according to what the qualifications were considered to be appropriate for, for white and Asian students, all the rest of them just based on the numbers wouldn\u2019t have gotten in. I respect what Tim Wise has said, we have very different data in terms of the qualifications, if it were true the qualifications were the same, this would be a rather vacuous and petty debate. But the fact is, that according to anything that I know, they\u2019re not. For example, one argument that we might hear before we leave tonight is that SAT\u2019s are meaningless. Now there are dueling studies on that, I\u2019m not sure exactly where one is to stand as a good-thinking person at this point. But certainly, it bears mentioning, that if you looked at UC Berkeley undergraduates who were black and their graduation rates after 1988, they actually tracked in virtual lock-step with SAT scores.", "The lower the score, the more likely the person was to graduate, that suggests to me something that I think all of us know deep down, which is that, no matter how you jigger the statistics, SAT scores do mean something, not everything, of course, but they do mean something. Or, for example, Richard Sandor has shown that, um\u2026with, um, black students admitted to 163 law schools, that, because so very many of them were admitted not according to the qualifications that they submitted but out of a sense of a commitment to diversity and lowering standards, that over half of them were in the bottom 10 percent of their class and that wasn\u2019t only in they first year, and that there was a truly alarming rate of failing the bar exam. Now, these are all difficult issues but things like this, and needless to say, I could go on for a very long time but I\u2019ve only got eight minutes\u2014they have to be brought into a debate like this, they cannot be ignored, they cannot be trivialized. These things are real. Also, to eliminate racial preferences at selective universities does not deny black people an education. At UC San Diego before the ban on racial preferences out in California, exactly one out of 3,268 freshmen who were black, were making honors. After the ban, 20 percent of black students were making honors, because the students who would have been admitted to Berkeley or UCLA were now admitted to UC-San Diego. I think that was a good thing. It certainly wasn\u2019t a bad thing. And it\u2019s something that needs to be talked about. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about diversity, because I think that\u2019s gonna come up. For one thing, I remember being in college, and this is purely anecdotal, but, the idea of someone calling on me in class to talk about, you know, my take on the black experience or what the black perspective on things was, was something that made me sweat bullets and I\u2019ve heard this from countless black undergraduates, many of whom tell me when I\u2019m doing a book tour that to them, that\u2019s evidence that there\u2019s racism at universities, that they\u2019re expected to be diverse representatives. So we can talk about diversity, but, how does it actually feel to be a diverse person. More to the point. It\u2019s often said that diversity has been proven to make for a better-quality education. Has it? How. Like if you\u2019ve ever actually looked into that, the people who try to prove it with studies, and none of them are conservatives, find again and again, that, as I think we all knew, diversity does not really have anything to do with giving you a more beneficial experience in terms of how much knowledge you have in your head or how much moral wisdom you have in your head, after you come from college. There was a poll of University of Michigan minority, um, law-school grads from 1970 to 1996. To them, being called on as a diverse person in class was at the very bottom of what they valued most about their experience as was the diversity. What they most valued in their experience was how smart teachers and their fellow students were, remember this is minority students. Or, Mitchell J. Chang showed that in terms of diversity in your undergraduate experience, it did mean that you talked about race more on campus, but it didn\u2019t mean that you had more friends of another race and it didn\u2019t improve your GPA and it didn\u2019t improve how you feel about going to college. Stephen Cole and Elinor Barber have shown that when black students are placed in schools where they actually would have been more appropriately placed in terms of qualifications and qualifications do matter, into schools like these, then, what happened is that they made lower grades which discouraged them from going to get Ph.D.\u2019s. This was a study done by good liberal people, they did not expect it. But that means that we have fewer black academics because of these policies. Now based on the things that I\u2019ve mentioned, and clear\u2014", "\u2014clearly they belong at the table. I do wanna say one thing. The idea that all of these sorts of things that I\u2019ve discussed, and the fact that there are other ways of addressing this problem, are there, and they\u2019re worth talking about. The notion that anybody would say, that, a legacy student is something that black students should be proud to compare themselves to, or, that a legacy student is something that is okay, I\u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t get it, I met legacy students when I was in school, it was not a pretty picture. I certainly do not agree with these legacy policies, however, because I\u2019m black, I\u2019m talking about this kind of policy as it is applied to people of my race because I think that it hurts them. I\u2019m not gonna make some hoary argument about the Constitution, or something like that. I don\u2019t think that it helps black students to be the best that they can be. And I think I\u2019ll stop there. But there are issues in this debate that we simply don\u2019t hear about.

I wanna tell you a little story about, um, my own experience, very recently I, I bought a house, um, in the Ditmas Park area of Brooklyn. And it\u2019s been, um, heralded as the most diverse census track in the country. And so when I moved there, I found that, you know, the adults, they were, they were a little bit more hesitant to mix. Um, but the\u2014but the young people at the, at the, at the pizza place, hung out, uh, with people of all different backgrounds, and little kids at the, at the, uh, playground were willing to play with each other, from all different backgrounds. And, this is something that I value. It\u2019s to something that I think is easy, it\u2019s not something that I think comes naturally. But it\u2019s something that\u2019ll only happen when people go to school together, when people are exposed to each other. And, preferably at an earlier age, and also in, in, in higher education. And you\u2014 so you should vote with us, if you agree with that statement, if you agree that a racially diverse environment is beneficial. If you believe that diversity enhances the educational experience, and that diversity is good for business and the economy. You should also vote with us, if you want a level playing field, not a false meritocracy, that is actually full of hidden benefits for the children of donors and legacies. Now, some of you may be wondering why I, a lawyer at the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, is here speaking out in support of affirmative action. Foes of affirmative action often like to say that Asians are the ones that are most harmed by affirmative action, that\u2019s simply not true. First of all, many Asian groups, Southeast Asians in particular who face numerous educational disadvantages, need and benefit from affirmative action in all contexts and in particular, higher education. And all Asian-Americans need and benefit from affirmative action employment. So, I wanna echo what Tim Wise said is that we\u2019re talking not just about diversity, about, uh, affirmative action in education, we\u2019re talking about affirmative action in a variety of different contexts, including education, public contracting and so forth. And we\u2019re also not just talking about a black and white paradigm, we\u2019re talking about how affirmative action benefits other people of color, as well as women. So you should vote for us. If you value a diverse and inclusive society, and want a broad variety of experiences and viewpoints represented at our most prestigious, uh, educational institutions and workplaces. Business leaders have long realized the value of diversity. When the University of Michigan\u2019s affirmative action programs were challenged before the United States Supreme Court, 65 leading American businesses, and their CEO\u2019s filed a brief in support of affirmative action. These included American Express, Chevron and Microsoft, Boeing, Nike, and the list goes on. They realized that the leaders of tomorrow needed exposure to diverse people, ideas and perspectives. These companies found that individuals educated in a diverse setting were more likely to succeed and they had very concrete, concrete examples of, of these benefits. They believed that\u2014they realized that people who were educated in a diverse setting were more likely to facilitate creative problem-solving approaches, they would\u2014they can develop progra\u2014uh, uh, products that appeal to a diverse customer base. They are better able to work with diverse business partners, clients and employees, and they\u2019re more likely to contribute to a positive work environment. These companies need, and I quote, \u201cthe talent and creativity of a workplace that is\u201d\u2014 or workforce rather\u2014\u201cthat is as diverse as the world around them.\u201d Minority professionals are also more likely to provide needed services to underserved communities. And this has been found in studies about minority doctors. Um, incidentally I\u2014I think that this point was acknowledged by my colleague John McWhorter on the other side. In a study by the New\u2014that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1996, it found that black and Latino communities were four times more likely to have a shortage of doctors, and, incidentally, black doctors tend to practice in communities with five times as many blacks as communities where other doctors practice. They also have more black patients, and more Medicaid patients. Latino doctors, similarly, tend to practice in communities with twice as many Latinos as communities where other doctors are, and they also have more Latino patients and more uninsured patients. You should also vote with us if you believe in leveling the playing field. Women and minorities still face obstacles gaining admissions to our most selective universities and workplaces. And the College Board\u2019s own studies show that SAT\u2019s are skewed in favor of whites and the wealthy. So, yeah, do I say the SAT\u2019s meaningless, probably not. But, what is that meaning and who is it skewed in favor of, des\u2014and despite these advantages that whites still have with standardized tests, there are still twice as many whites as minorities with below-average scores, in the top universities and this is because they\u2019re legacies or the kids of donors. Legacies are three times more likely than general population to be admitted at Harvard and two and a half more times at Yale and over half of legacies are admitted at Dartmouth and Penn. Now turning to Asian-Americans, foes of affirmative action as I said love to use as a poster child for who would benefit if affirmative action ended and this is just not true. First of all, Asians have voted decisively in favor of affirmative action, in both California and Michigan when these policies were challenged. And, now, it\u2019s true that some Asian-American students have done remarkably well in higher education, and these are disproportionately the children of highly-educated professionals, who immigrated here predominantly from, um, East Asia and South Asia starting with the change in immigration laws in the 1960s. But there are other Asian-American students that face considerable educational barriers. In particular Southeast Asians, who are the children of refugees who fled here after the Vietnam war, from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. I do a lot of my work in Lowell, Massachusetts, which is the second-largest Cambodian enclave in the country. A third of Lowell\u2019s schoolchildren are Asian, predominantly Cambodian. But, 45 percent, a disproportionate number of Lowell\u2019s school\u2014of Lowell\u2019s dropouts and students who are dismissed for sev\u2014severe truancy are Asian-American. Almost one in two Hmong, and the Hmong are, um, an ethnic group that hails from Laos, and over one in four Cambodians in the United States have had no formal schooling whatsoever. In the affirmative action plans endorsed by the United States Supreme Court and the University of Michigan cases, you can consider a broad array of, of diversity factors, of which being\u2014coming from a family of Southeast Asian refugees, can count. Proposition 209 ended affirmative action in California in 1996. Coincidentally this was the same year that I graduated from Boalt Hall School of Law, and as an aside, it was the diversity at Boalt, which was\u2014Boalt was very diverse at the time\u2014that in part inspired me to be a civil-rights lawyer. And after\u2014", "\u2014after affirmative action ended, diversity within the Asian- American population has suffered at\u2014at most selective University of California schools. At Boalt Hall School of Law, there were more than four times as may Filipinos, and\u2014with affirmative action than without, and overall the number of Asian-Americans has dropped by 1 percent at all UC law schools in the first three years without affirmative action. Whites on the other hand increased by 12 percent. At UC Berkeley undergrad, a study by the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center found less than 50 total Cambodian that\u2019s far less than 1 percent, fif\u2014less than 50 total Cambodian and Lao, at UC-Berkeley in 1993. And the case for affirmative action in employment is even clearer for Asian-Americans, there\u2019s less than 1 percent of partners in major law firms are Asian-American and less than 1 percent of senior managers at Fortune 1000 and Fortune 500 firms. That\u2019s very similar to the weights of representation for blacks and Latinos, but of white men are 97 percent of senior partners, of senior management, at Fortune 1000 and Fortune 100 firms, even though they\u2019re only\u2014", "\u201443 percent of the workplace\u2014", "\u2014of the workforce, thank you very much\u2014"], "speaker": "Khin Mai Aung", "nontext": {}}, {"speakertype": "mod", "segment": 0, "paragraphs": ["One."], "speaker": "Robert Siegel", "nontext": {}}, {"speakertype": "against", "segment": 0, "paragraphs": ["\u2014after affirmative action ended, diversity within the Asian- American population has suffered at\u2014at most selective University of California schools.

Uh, look, for the last 40 years America\u2019s been engaged in a massive social experiment, to see whether the use of racial preferences could bring about the full integration of American soci\u2014society. The question tonight is whether these preferential policies can deliver on that promise. And the question need not be abstract nor need it divide liberals and conservatives. That\u2019s because in the last decade, a growing body of data has become available, that helps us get a handle on the trade-off between attending an elite institution, on the basis of different admissions standards, or attending a less prestigious institution. Let\u2019s start with the effect of racial preferences, uh, in undergraduate colleges. I\u2019m going to focus on one specific academic area, namely science. Not many minority students enter science, and many who do drop out along the way. Blacks receive about 5.3 percent of the bachelor\u2019s degrees in science, despite making up about 9 percent of the college enrollment. Well research into these disparities by Dartmouth psychologist Rogers Elliot, provides a template of the kinds of questions we should be asking not just in the area of science, but in every area, where preferential policies are employed. Because it turns out that the preferences themselves, are part of the problem. The first thing that Elliot\u2019s data does, is dispel the assumption that non-Asian minority students somehow aren\u2019t interested in science. In fact, high-achieving black and Hispanic high school seniors, are more interested in majoring in science, than whites. The second thing the data tells us is that the really elite research universities, the schools that recruit the most promising students, black and white, use significant racial preferences to enroll the most gifted and talented black and\u2014black and Hispanic undergraduates. Elliot\u2019s nineteen ninety-sev\u20141997 study, fo\u2014which focused on four Ivy League schools, found that the mean SAT math score for black students was 100 points below that of white students. That difference was about 1.6 times this\u2014sorry, 1.6 standard deviations of the white scores. This means that the black mean was not only below the white mean, it was so far below the white mean that the majority of black students had scores in the bottom 10 percent of the distribution of scores of all students. Now right away this significant use of race preferences by the most elite schools is significant. The fact that the very top schools, that have their pick of the best students, are using preferences of this magnitude, suggests that the next tier of schools are likely using greater preferences, and in fact, second-tier schools do use greater preferences, about 15 percent larger than those used by the top schools. As a consequence, many black and Hispanic students up and down the line are attending schools where their credentials are significantly out of line with those of their, uh, classmates. Well one possible response at this point, and we may hear this later on tonight, is to say that the SAT math score doesn\u2019t fairly measure black academic success. One could even deny that admitting black students with lower SAT math scores amounts to a preference. Well, we could debate this all night, but the research on this point is undisputed. If anything grades and SAT scores over-predict black performance. So admitting blacks and Hispanics with significantly lower test scores and grades make it all but certain that blacks and Hispanics as a group, will get lower grades as\u2014in college, and that\u2019s just what Elliot found. Blacks interested in science at these schools had grades almost a full GPA lower than whites. For many students, many minority students this made it difficult to continue in science, and Elliot found that only a third of the blacks who started in science, at elite schools, uh, completed a degree in science. The rest switched majors, or dropped out altogether. Uh, and this rate was twice the rate of white students at those schools. Second, uh, the lower grades of those who did finish disadvantaged them significantly both in going on to graduate school, and getting jobs. Well, if the story ended here you might think that test-score gaps make it highly unlikely that blacks will ever, or a significant number of blacks will ever succeed in science. Uh, this would be a very dreary conclusion if it were true but the fact is, it\u2019s not true. This is where the data tells us something very interesting, it helps us get a handle on the real problem with preferential policies, because it turns out that the absolute value of a students math SAT score and high school grades, is less important, as the relative difference between one\u2019s credentials, and those of his or her classmates. How do we know this. Well, it turns out that black students interested in science, who attend schools where their math SAT scores more closely match that of other students, persist in science at much higher rates, even though the average SAT scores at these schools is lower. So for example, Howard University, a historically black college, has average SAT math scores of about 450, well below the mean of the, at the, the, uh, SAT score, at the elite schools we\u2019ve been discussing, yet Howard is the top producer of black undergraduate science and engineering degrees in the country. What\u2019s more, a large percentage of undergraduate science majors at Howard and other historically black colleges, go on to get Ph.D.\u2019s in science. Of the top 21 undergraduate producers of black Ph.D.\u2019s in the country, 17 of them, 17 of the 21, are historically black colleges, and none are among the 30 or so most selective schools that routinely recruit the most talented black high school students. And so what we have is this perverse system. The institutions with the poorest track records for producing black Ph.D.\u2019s in science, are getting the best minority students, and then, driving them out of science at twice the rate of white students. And the institutions with the best track record, are getting the middling students, and then, producing the overwhelming majority of black Ph.D.\u2019s in science. Well what lessons can we draw from this. First, the existence of racial inequalities in society which nobody on this side of the table denies, is not a sufficient justification for preferential policies. It\u2019s bad enough that African-Americans are so substantially underrepresented in science. It\u2019s completely inexcusable that racial preferences end up frustrating and discouraging the gifted black high school seniors who say they want to study science. Second, it is misleading to evaluate racial preferences in the abstract, as if we\u2019re talking about one\u2014", "\u2014or two institutions that use preferences in a handful of deserving cases. What we\u2019re dealing with, the problem that we\u2019ve got, is the systematic use of racial preferences by every single institution of higher education in the country. I\u2019ve used my time to focus on one specific problem in some detail, but a growing body of research shows similar effects in many other areas. Surely all of us can agree, that schools should be required to publish graduation rates and grade distributions, and yes, persistence in majors, broken down according to the different preferences granted, and that means all of them, including racial preferences, alumni preferences and athletic preferences, the problem is the same in all cases.

I\u2019m Kim, and I am a beneficiary of affirmative action. Despite what our opponents want you to think, Americans continue to support African-American for women and for people of color. When the precise question of eliminating affirmative action was put to voters in Houston, Texas, the majority repudiated this radical agenda. In supporting affirmative action Americans inherently know that while it is one thing to pull down those \u201cNo trespass\u201d signs, it is another task altogether, to build pathways to and through our institutions, that are genuinely and visibly open to all. This continuing support of affirmative action is even more remarkable, given how the media, and lukewarm supporters, have acquiesced to the terms of the debate that have been set by well-funded, think tank-produced critics. Think for just a moment about what is missing in the way that affirmative action is usually framed. The debate is usually premised on the metaphor of an equal-opportunity race, where we all began at the starting line. The societal rewards go to the swiftest and the most talented. Now the problem with affirmative action as we are led to believe, is that it distorts the race by giving some people a head start, halfway around the track. So when the winner is a woman, or a person of color, or for goodness sakes, a woman of color, supposedly we all know that it isn\u2019t because she was the swiftest runner, or thinker, or planner, but because of the head start that she happened to get. Now, some supporters of affirmative action will agree that the runner got a head start, but will justify the head start in terms of a diverse society. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for diversity, it\u2019s the language of inclusion used by the military, by corporate America, virtually all colleges and universities and yes, by the Supreme Court too. These are good allies to have on our side and on this one, they\u2019re firmly with us. But while all sides of this debate focus on the disabilities of the runner, they wind up missing entirely the crippling conditions of the track. So what if instead of training our gaze at the runner, we looked instead at the conditions of the track. What if we really looked at the different lanes that America\u2019s runners have to run in. If we looked at that we see that some of those lanes are nicely paved, even surfaces, beautifully well-lit with freshly painted lines. Other Americans though have to navigate lanes that are riddled with obstacles and debris, where to stay in the race they have to climb walls, scale barriers, cross over craters, avoid detours, and confront a host of conditions that others never face, just in order to even see the finish line. Affirmative action is quite simply a commitment to remove the effects of these obstacles that impede the race for some, using a wide variety of tactics and strategies, now, the other side will riddle us with language about, um, preferences\u2014 they\u2019ll talk about racial preferences, they won\u2019t talk about gender preferences\u2014as a way to get you to forget what you know about the track, and to focus instead of what you think you know about the runners. Now, there\u2019s a wealth of information that gives content to the obstacles, that run a full gamut from traditional discrimination employment, where blacks with a high school diploma, actually, actually lose out in the competition to whites with a criminal record. And where the same resume\u2026 receives 50 percent fewer white, uh, call-backs than black-sounding names do. To underfunded schools, school districts with the highest concentration of black students receive the lowest share of resources, and the prison to, uh, the school-to-prison pipeline where kids as young as six are handcuffed, and set on a fast track to prison, rather than a highway to college. To hyper- segregation that isolates minorities from key social networks through which most job-seekers actually find employment, to newer evidence about stereotype threat that makes gifted students unperfor\u2014underperform on high-stakes tests, to implicit bias that unconsciously shapes people\u2019s attitudes, and their behaviors towards minorities. That makes cops think they see a gun instead of a wallet. That makes teachers think they see an imbecile instead of a hungry child. That makes men think they see a ball-busting diva rather than a high-performing managerThat makes high-per\u2014highway patrollers think that they see traffickers transporting drugs rather than a high school basketball team celebrating a nail-clinching victory. This evidence from disciplines as diverse as sociology, economics, law, com\u2014cognitive science, reflects just the barest summary of the conditions that are out there. Modest efforts to build bridges and patches over these obstacles, are not preferences. They are corrections to ensure equal opportunity. Now, to be sure, there are preferences that are up there. And they are dangerous and obsolete, I\u2019m talking about the preferences for wealth, for legacies, for power, for social networking, preferences that permit this privileged and lucky cohort to simply show up at the race to win, they don\u2019t have to run, they don\u2019t have to work hard, no one scolds them or their families or their communities about discipline, and they don\u2019t have to break a sweat. Let\u2019s take the guy up there on the people mover. Through his family\u2019s money, his daddy\u2019s connections, a bunch of good old boy backers, a society trained to look the other way, this guy can get a C average at Yale, enjoy a undistinguished record at Harvard B School and in due course simply lean over to the finish line, to receive the most coveted job in the country. If there is a poster boy against real preferences, who better than George Bush. But now, how is it that this colossal preference that attends to the privilege is overlooked, I call it, look, it\u2019s a black-man strategy. Look at this, check this out. Now. This cover appeared on Newsweek during the controversy over affirmative action at the University of Michigan, \u201cAffirmative Action\u201410 Ways to Think About it Now.\u201d Now, let\u2019s think about this picture for a minute, what are at least three ways that we\u2019re told we\u2019re supposed to think about affirmative action. It\u2019s important for you to know that Newsweek was communicating a message here. This person wasn\u2019t a student involved in Michigan, he was a model, he was photographed, many times with various attire, to arrive at the picture that showed the message that Newsweek wanted you to know. As Janine Jacks reported in her study of affirmative action, \u201cMedia coverage routinely focuses on race not gender, on blacks not other people of color, on elites not people of color from all classes and genders.\u201d White women are the single largest group to benefit from these\u2014", "\u2014programs, as recorded by the labor statistics, but you certainly wouldn\u2019t know it, from the way the media covered it. What does this tell you about the nature of the debate when in fact the real picture of affirmative action, looks a little bit more like this. Well, what it\u2019s supposed to tell you, is that affirmative action is in fact about people of color of all races, and it\u2019s supposed to tell you that it\u2019s actually about women as well. So I submit, that people of good will should recoil from the bait-and- switch tactic. They should recoil from any kind of argument that frames this solely in terms of racial preference, and solely in terms of one group. I would submit to you that the proposal to eliminate affirmative action repudiates King\u2019s call, that day standing in front of the statue of Abe Lincoln to make good on its promises of fairness, freedom of equality It substitutes that soaring oratory for a simple three-monkey solution to our problems.

So, they're not being mismatched, they're not unqualified, there are other things that recommend them for the spot. So, we ought to expect and try to make sure everyone does well. We also ought to have a criteria that is both more fair and representative, but also more accurate. It doesn\u2019t serve anyone\u2019s interests to use a criteria that does not, in fact, predict success, and those tests simply do not. In fact, one study of law schools, talking about law schools, University of Michigan study found that there was an inverse relationship between LSAT score and future professional success.

And thank you, John. We're gathered here tonight to talk about our intelligence, and about whether our smartphones, and our apps, and our social media accounts are expanding it or eroding it.", "Are we more thoughtful now, thanks to our technologies, or less thoughtful? And I think you can approach that question from two different angles. And a little bit later, my colleague, Andrew Keen, is going to look at it from a social and cultural angle. How is the technology influencing our collective intelligence? What I'd like to do is talk about it from a very personal, individual level. How is the technology influencing the way our minds work? And now, by now I think all of us, if we're honest, know pretty well how we use our gadgets. We use them compulsively. And the research bears this out. The average person with a smartphone will pull out the phone and look at it about 150 times a day. And that breaks down to about six minutes for your every waking hour. The average teenager or 20-- early 20-something-year-old will send or receive about 4,000 text messages a month.", "And that also breaks down to about one every six minutes. And when you start to add up all the messages, all the notifications, all the alerts, all the Pins, all the Instagrams, all the Google searches, and everything else, what you get is a clear picture that we have created, with this powerful digital technology, a new environment for ourselves. An environment of constant distraction-- almost perpetual interruption. Now, that suits the purposes, suits the interests of companies like Google and Facebook, because they make more money the more we gobble up little bits of information. But what does it actually do to our brains and how our brains operate? To answer that question, I think we have to look at how we transform information, which is just the raw material of thinking, into actual knowledge.", "And that process hinges on the transfer of that information between two forms of memory. On the one hand, you have your working memory, which is essentially the contents of your consciousness at any given moment. What you're thinking about right now is your working memory. And we know-- what we know about working memory is it has an extremely small Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb capacity. You can only hold about two to four pieces of information in your mind, your conscious mind, simultaneously. And then on the other side, you have our long-term memory, what we usually refer to as \"memory.\u201d The store of all the facts you know, the experiences you've had, the people you recognize. And this-- if working memory is very small capacity, long-term memory has a huge capacity. You can never actually fill it up. You can never get to the point where you say, \"I can't remember anything anymore.\u201d The key to building knowledge, the key to deep intelligence is being able to move incoming information from your conscious mind over into your long-term memory.", "This is a process called \"memory consolidation,\" and it's through this consolidation that you create connections and associations between what you're experiencing now, what you're learning now, and what you already know. And it's those connections and associations between the information and the experiences in your mind that form the basis for true knowledge. That is the foundation for conceptual thinking, critical thinking, creative thinking. The problem, today, is that we're constantly overloading that small store of our working memory. And this creates a phenomenon-- an actual biological phenomenon called \"cognitive overload.\u201d If you think about it, if you can only hold two to four pieces of information in your conscious mind, then if you're constantly taking in new information, you have to push the existing information out very, very quickly in order to make room.", "And what we know is that consolidation, this kind of weaving together of information into knowledge, requires attentiveness. It's only when you attend to something in your working memory that you actually transfer it to your working memory and make it part of your knowledge. What we've created, in other words, is an environment that is constantly frustrating our mind's ability to create deep knowledge and to think deeply. Now, we are right to celebrate all the great things we get from smart technologies, from the internet. It's great to celebrate the fact that we have access to all this information and all this conversation immediately. But what we too often forget is that information is not knowledge, it's not intelligence, and it's certainly not wisdom. And when we spend all of our time gathering information, what gets crowded out is the time to distance yourself from distractions and interruptions and think deeply about things, think deeply about the experiences you're having, think deeply about the new facts you're learning, think deeply about the conversation you're having.", "This is the kind of thinking that the internet and smart devices in general, by peppering us with messages and little bits of information all day long, is stealing from us. We're losing that contemplative, deep, focused, attentive state of mind that is crucial to the creation of knowledge, the creation of intelligence, and deep thinking in general. So even though we can Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb celebrate all the great things the internet does, I think we have to be honest with ourselves. And I would suggest you look not only to the science and not only to what everybody on the stage is going to say, but to your own experience with the technology, how you use it, whether, when you want to think deeply, you pull out your smartphone, or you try to distance yourself from your smartphone and from your computers. And by thinking about your own experience, I think you'll get a clue to the broader theme of what this technology is doing to us.", "And I think, if you're honest with yourself, you'll conclude that indeed our smart technologies are making us dumb, and you'll vote for that proposition.

If we take the question, \"Is our smart tech making us dumb,\" I want to not even refute that. I want to ask, why do we keep asking that? Because if \"smart\" means that we make good decisions, then we are-- new predictive technologies, very smart-- enable us to do that. If being smart means understanding more, we now have from the Higgs boson to the Hubble telescope, we have the ability through our smart technology to understand more about a universe that's 14 billion years old. And if \"smart\" means better at our work, then I absolutely, and you absolutely, want your doctor, your auto mechanic, and your airplane pilot to have the smartest technology that there is. So why do we have ask? I think in part it's because of the shock of the new. And this is very, very new, what's going on. Andy Clark is a philosopher who makes a point that we don't know, we don't think in our heads.", "Smart Technology is Making Us DumbWe think with things in the world, out in the world. So a mathematician thinks with chalk on a blackboard. An architect thinks with models in her hands or using a straight edge or something. And a meteorologist who is using our old tech, who just has a weather vane is not going to be nearly as smart as a meteorologist who's gather data from sensors around the world, big data put to use to predict the weather down to the hour. That's really, really smart. And it's our smart technology that lets us do that. If Clark is right, and I think he is, that we think of objects out in the world, and if those tools change, and if they change radically, then the way that we think changes radically, which is why I think we even consider the possibility that our smart tech is making us dumb when all the evidence seems to be that in fact we are smarter in the important ways than ever. Another reason perhaps we entertain this notion is that we have a natural tendency to think that the technology we grew up with is natural and is good. But that's not the case.", "We didn't invent gatekeepers because we said-- in the old world, in a prior world-- we didn't invent gatekeepers because we thought it was just a swell idea to vastly limit the amount of information and knowledge that we were going to make public, and we didn't say, \"You know what would be really swell? Let's create a set of homogenous white guys, and they'll decide what makes it through those gates.\u201d We invented gatekeepers because the old medium, that technology of paper, was so limited. It had gates, and the gates were really, really narrow. And so we needed to have gatekeepers. But now we don't. Now the gates are down. We have this huge abundance, and we adopt new strategies for that. And sometimes it's disconcerting. One of the main strategies is that we skim. We skim a lot. That's actually a really adaptive technology-- technique for dealing with it. And it's not even an old technique. It's a technique that we use when we go into an old-fashioned real bookstore and there are thousands of titles, and we skim them on the shelves really quickly to find what we're interested-- and that-- so we still do that now.", "We're doing it online. And just as then, when we find something that's interesting to us, we are able to drill down into it. We start reading it. It's-- in this age of constant distraction, we can't focus, we're watching seven years of \"Game of Thrones,\" the most complex narrative that we've ever seen in our world. And I'll see you Sunday night. It's great. We love this stuff. Our children are reading seven volumes of complex, intricate narrative and characterization. Our universities are turning out experts and scholars who are deep into their topics, deeper than ever because they can go that deep because of the internet. So I don't think the evidence is there, despite the brain chemistry, that we are in fact not knowing. We are knowing more and better than ever.", "Smart Technology is Making Us DumbIf you think back to the 1980s, for example, you get a newspaper, you'd read the article, you'd find something, you'd read an article. It was really exciting, you wanted to know more. You want-- but you can't because it's 1980. And all you've got was that rectangle of print. That's what it was like before we had smart technology. You were just stuck. It's infuriating even to think about at this point. That's not right. It's certainly not natural. So let me give you an example: 1911, with the-- sorry, Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica had its first article on Oliver Goldsmith, the playwright, 6,000 words long. Each new edition, that gets shorter because they've got to cram in more stuff. By 1994, it's down to 1,500 words which means that it's-- the editors of the Britannica, the gatekeepers of knowledge and culture, have thrown out 75 percent of what Britannica knows about Goldsmith, because that's how paper works. Wikipedia article, it's 1,400 words, but you've got to count all of the-- look into all of the links, decide which ones of those count in the total for Goldsmith.", "You can do the apples to apples. It's-- and there will be much more. And people will disagree about what-- which of those links count, which is fine, because in Wikipedia and on the web overall, knowledge is no longer crammed into rectangles. They assume a much more natural shape, which is that of a web, which is-- has near infinite capacity. It enables us to accommodate much more complexity of relationships, indefinite complexity, is much bigger than any one brain could ever have made. And we get to see how the knowledge is made, which is in many ways very disconcerting. We see that it's human. It's a human product. It's full of fallibility, we see the people are arguing, they're adding, they're getting things wrong, they're getting things right. That's how knowledge is made. That's how knowledge was always made. But now we can see it. It's in our face. And that's a truth. That's a truth about knowledge that was always true of knowledge. But now that we can see it, we're beginning-- it's an amazing thing. We're beginning to invent and discover together new ways of building knowledge, of talking together and building knowledge.", "This has-- we've never been in a period like this before. But it may-- it's upsetting because now we have to face the truth that knowledge has always, always been a human product and always, therefore, subject to and characterized by the fallibility of humans. So it seems clear to me that to argue that our smart tech is making us dumb is not only to be on the wrong side of history; in this case, it's to be on the wrong side of evolution.

Perhaps if we were academics, we would call it, \"the death of distance,\" the end of distance. So we have these devices. I know this is radio, but on the radio you can imagine what I'm waving. We have the death of distance. We have a culture of intimacy, of personalization.", "This is the culture of intimacy and personalization that has replaced what you described as \"narrow gatekeepers.\u201d We all become the media in this world.

It explains our contemporary cult of authenticity, this idea that we always have to be true to ourselves.", "It's, of course, a manifestation of a particularly corrupted nature of democracy, a world where everything is intimate, everything is personalized. Nick described it in scientific terms I guess as not only the end of distance, the end of depth, and the end of objectivity. Everything, then, in this media, in this world of smart technology is personalized. Everything is intimate. Everything is telling the world what we think. Everything is confirming what we already think. So this so- called smart technology-- I don't know where we get this term. The person who came up with the term, \"smart technology,\" should be spanked, at least metaphorically, because I don't know where the word came from. There's nothing smart about personalized, intimate technology. It simply confirms our misplaced ideal that the world revolves around us. It's a pre-Copernican notion. And ironically it's technology confirming that.", "Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb Technology by definition, as I'm sure some Frankfurt theorist like Walter Benjamin once argued, technology is by definition romantic and nostalgic and reactionary. So don't accuse Nick and I of being that. We are the progressives. We are the ones looking forward. It's technologists, or people with a belief in the idea of technology as salvation who are reactionaries, they-- they're the ones who want to drive us back, like Rousseau, to some idealized community. So what do we have? We have then a technology of intimacy, which is resulting, in cultural and social terms, in a more and more personalized culture, a platform where we tell the world what we're doing, what we're thinking. It represents the disappearance, the death not only of distance but of communication. We struggle more and more to talk to one another. Sherry Turkle wrote a brilliant book called, \"Alone Together.\u201dThis technology is indeed making us alone together. It's a technology not only, as Nick said, of distraction, but of atomization, of alienation. This is Durkheim on steroids. This is a world of profound disorientation and destruction of the community. So what we have, then, in epistemological terms, is the disappearance of that kind of objectivity that Nick talks about. I think David described it-- he thinks this is a good thing, epistemological chaos. Everyone saying everything at the same time, and no one listening to anyone else. The ultimate-- the ultimate consequence, of course, of this is the selfie. This is a selfie culture. This is a culture where the ultimate expression is photographing ourselves in front of a masterpiece, in front of Auschwitz, in front of someone jumping off the Bay Bridge.", "These are true examples of selfie culture. Meanwhile, what's going on? David celebrates the narrow gatekeepers that are being destroyed. But of course, since we have this so-called smart technology, what has happened to those gatekeepers? We're seeing not only the death of distance, but the death of newspapers, the death of recorded music, the death of the professional creative class, the people who made their living thinking, the people who have made their living writing books, the people who made their living writing articles for newspapers, the people who made their living taking photographs. That kind of Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb professionalism is in crisis. Some people even believe that the creative professional is a thing of the past. So, what we have is this double whammy. On the one hand, personalization, intimacy, driven more and more into ourselves, into an echo chamber culture, where we never listen to anything anyone else is saying, particularly if it dissonates with us.", "And on the other hand, the death of a professional culture.

When I was given the task of taking on this proposition, as someone who did debate in high school-- which is a long time ago-- I was struck by the impulse to want to deconstruct the question. It's an anthropological approach too, right? And ask \"What is smart technology?\" Echoing Andrew's concern of what on earth that might mean. What does \u201cdumb\u201d mean? Is smart/dumb the only binary pair that we could have, and is dumb necessarily, as an anthropologist, I might want to ask, a bad thing? I mean, clearly we're putting a set of cultural and moral values around dumbness that are interesting.

So, David said to me, \"No, Genevieve, don't deconstruct the argument.\u201d So I'm taking his advice. I am, however, going to want to suggest that smart technology has made us smart in some unexpected ways. It's made us more responsive. It's made us more engaged. And in the case of both Andrew and I, it's made us more enraged and I'm not necessarily convinced that's a bad thing. So, how might I go about proving that? Well, I think there's a couple of places you'd look to. And many of them are outside of this room, and Manhattan, and outside of the United States. Smart technology makes us smart and it makes us safer. If you were to look, in the last year, I can pull you examples from all over the world. In many African countries and on the Indian subcontinent, mobile phones and text messages are used by governments to send out health warnings and preventative health messages. When the Ebola outbreak was taking place, messages were sent on smartphones to tell people how to handle themselves, their communities, and the bodies that they were encountering. Hardly dumb, right? In Australia, where I come from, all the volunteer fire services, which is how we keep ourselves safe in the fire season, use a geo-located app service that sends out notifications to Australians to tell them there's a bush fire near them, to tell them what to do in a high-fire danger day, which isn't always obvious.", "And how to think about being safer and ultimately smarter about how we inhabit a dangerous landscape. In the United States, you have the Amber alert, something I'm sure many of you hope to never see on your telephones. But when you do, you know what to do. It's about making a community and the kids in it hopefully safer and ultimately making all of us smarter about danger. And it will be hard to argue with what\u2019s happened in Nepal over the last three and a half weeks as people have mobilized all sorts of technology to bring both relief and comfort to a community that was clearly struggling. In all of those cases, is smart technology making us dumber? I hardly think so. And if you were to move further out from that frame and think about cultural knowledge, we talked a lot about intelligence, we talked a lot about book learning. But let's think a little bit about cultural knowledge.", "I'm the child of an anthropologist. I grew up with indigenous people in Australia. I spent a lot of time in indigenous communities, and it's been fascinating to watch over the last 20 years as Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb those communities have embraced new technologies to do old things. The Ngadjuri with whom my family have worked for the last 20 years, used the internet to tell their stories. They like the fact that newspapers are being archived because they can use the stories in those about their colonial contact and argue about how to regain their land. The Diri and the Kukuda are using IOT sensors to combine traditional knowledge about climate with state- based knowledge about climate change to think about how to occupy their land better. And the Anangu in central Australia have an electronic medical records system that is a marvel of the world and has changed the health outcomes in that community. Is smart tech, in those instances, making those communities dumber? I hardly think so. And is it about a vacuum and people just talking to each other? I don't think that's the right way to think about it, either. Moving closer to home, at Intel, we're deeply concerned about diversity in the tech community, about diversity in STEM education. And one of our challenges frequently is to convince young women and ethnic minorities that there's room for them inside the sciences.", "And one of the ways you do that is by telling the stories of people who've been there before. Finding the stories of women pioneers and under-represented minorities who were pioneers used to be difficult. It's nice to be in New York for me. I get to go visit Judy Chicago's dinner table at the Brooklyn Museum, and I think about how hard it was for her to reclaim all of those women's names and how much easier it is to do it today. My Twitter feed just recently brought me the name of Sharla Boheim who actually was the original lead name on pocket-- packet simulation technology. You don't need to know what it is, but it's the foundation of the internet. And she was involved. Until quite recently, people didn't know that. So is using smart technology to tell our stories and tell them widely and bring more people into the conversation making us dumb? I certainly hope not, because it's something I participate in regularly. And almost last but by no means least, let's tackle the notion of community and citizenship. Andrew brought it up. Let's take it on a little bit more seriously. What have we used smart technology for from the last 18 months to think about notions of citizenship beyond the United States and within it?", "Were the students who were protesting at Mong Kok in Hong Kong say that smart technology was making them dumb? I don't think so. Would-- and I'm never going to get this man's name right, so I apologize in advance-- but would Feidin Santana think that he was doing something dumb when he took out his camera phone and recorded a policeman shooting someone in South Carolina? And we watched the video rocket around America and drive yet a further conversation about race and violence, and what it means to be a citizen? We can dismiss hashtag activism-- such a great phrase-- as being a sort of a fleeting thing, right? Whether it's #blacklivesmatter, #notallmen, #SOSblackAustralia from my hometown. But truthfully the use of technology to propel conversations about citizenship is hardly new. A photograph made a huge difference in how we talked about the Vietnam War. The radio and vinyl records, which Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb are making a comeback, I'll have you know, helped distribute the word of Martin Luther King. And the suffragettes really liked a good typewriter.", "So is smart technology in those cases making us dumb? I don't think so. Does it mean we still have a lot of work to do as citizens? Absolutely. And lest I end on a depressing note, because I realize being told you have more work is depressing, let me just reflect briefly on something else. Smart technology is also in our everyday lives. And some of those things we may not think about as making us smart, but they're certainly changing, I would argue, for the better personhood. Here's my last example: Online dating, because you should end on a good note. When I was in India doing fieldwork many years ago, a place that had been embracing this technology for a long time, a woman said to me, \"Getting a husband is just a database problem.\" And she said the matrimonial time-- matrimonial classified section of the Times of India changed everything for us because the database got bigger. So, let us imagine, from changing ideas of citizenship and safety, to ideas of romance to ideas of what it means to be in the world, it's really hard, I imagine, for any of us to sit in this room and to agree to the proposition that smart technology is making us dumb. So along with David, I think you should emphatically vote against it.

The motion is this: Smart technology is making us dumb. We have two debaters argue strenuously for the motion. They have made the argument that the new technology-- and we all know what we're talking about because it's in our pockets-- is creating a new environment of constant distraction and perpetual interruption which leads to a kind of cognitive overload, which ultimately diminishes attentiveness, and as a result, accumulation and use of knowledge suffers.

Um\u2026but, we also value security a great deal also. Uh, 9/11 presented an unprecedented type of threat. It\u2019s clear that there are terrorists out there who will inflict the, the\u2026 deadliest kind of means at their disposal, to, to create grievous harm for civilians here. And, uh, the traditional legal framework of dealing with soldiers or dealing with criminals, uh, was never created with that kind of threat in mind. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s sort of self-evident, uh, that the lines that were drawn prior to 9/11 must be drawn differently. But the question is how differently. And one would expect a lively national debate on an issue of this kind of importance, it\u2019s very timely. Um\u2026 In the news recently has been scrutiny of international banking transactions. Uh, wiretaps without warrants. Just in the last week or so, there\u2019ve been proposed renewal and revisions of, of FISA, the Fed\u2014 Foreign Intelligence, uh, Surveillance Act. But the debate on these kinds of issues has been somewhat clouded by a, a,\u2026general skepticism I would say of the Bush administration both in terms of its competence and judgment. And, uh, our hope tonight is really to transcend, uh, partisan bickering, transcend ideology, because getting the trade-off between privacy and security right, demands reasoned discourse. And our lives may depend upon it. So, uh, it\u2019s now my real pleasure to turn the evening over to the stellar panelists that, uh, uh, that Dana Wolfe our executive producer has put together this evening. Our moderator is Chris Bury, who\u2019s known to you all from ABC News \u201cNightline.\u201d He\u2019s reported extensively on national politics and policy issues including the intelligence community. He anchored \u201cNightline\u201d from Afghanistan, from CENTCOM war headquarters, and in a network first, from the Fort Meade headquarters of the National Security Agency. He\u2019s earned five Emmy Awards for his work on \u201cNightline,\u201d received Columbia University DuPont honors for his reporting on \u201cWorld News Tonight,\u201d so I\u2019m pleased to add the au\u2014hand the evening over to Chris Bury."], "speaker": "Robert Rosenkranz", "nontext": {"laughter": [[0, 7]]}}, {"speakertype": "mod", "segment": 0, "paragraphs": ["Thank you, Bob, for that kind introduction. And I\u2019d like to thank you as well for your considerable efforts to raise the substance, elevate the substance and the tone of public conversation on, on matters of public policy, we\u2019re all grateful for that, thank you. Now I would like to welcome you officially to the seventh Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I\u2019ll give you a brief rundown of how things are gonna go this evening. First the proposers of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument, \u201cBetter more domestic surveillance than another 9/11.\u201d The opposition will follow. Each person will get a maximum of eight minutes, and we\u2019ll go back and forth between the two sides. Each speaker will get a notice from me with one minute to go. And debaters, when you get that one-minute warning it really is time to wrap things up, because when your time has come, it is my job to cut you off with all the mercy of Robespierre at the guillotine. Not to be rude but because this is a radio broadcast and we\u2019re gonna try to keep the trains, uh, running on time here. Second, when all speakers are finished with their opening remarks, I\u2019m gonna follow up and try to get you going with some civil exchange. And then we\u2019re gonna open up the floor to the audience, and for audience members, uh, we\u2019d ask you to keep your questions short and, uh, to the point, you may wanna direct them at an individual panelist or you may want to direct them at one particular side of, of the argument. We ask that you refrain from giving speeches, we just don\u2019t have the time. After the Q-and-A, each debater will make a final statement, lasting not longer than two minutes. And after the final closing argument you will vote on tonight\u2019s motion, with the keypad which is attached to the arm-rest of your seat. Finally I will announce the results of the audience vote, and tell you which of these sides has carried the day. For those of you who have attended previous debates, you probably had one of those little cards, and let me see if I, if I have one here, you\u2019re probably used to this. Um, tonight we\u2019re gonna try something new, and, uh, vote with an electronic system. And, uh, I think Diebold made it so there shouldn\u2019t be any problem at all\u2026 But we will ask for your patience because, uh, this is a virgin attempt at this electronic system. And so, uh, let\u2019s find a\u2014here we go, the\u2014 it looks like a little calculator, does everybody have\u2026 located this, it should be on the side of your\u2026 arm-rest, so, see if you can find these\u2026 All right, everybody have \u2018em? So before we hear the arguments from our panelists, let\u2019s see how you feel on the question right now. So pick up the keypad\u2026and after my prompt, you will press 1 if you are for the motion, \u201cBetter more surveillance than another 9/11,\u201d press 2 if you are against that motion, and press 3 if you\u2019re undecided. And you may begin voting now. Everybody got that, 1 if you\u2019re for, 2 against, and 3 undecided. And I don\u2019t see any panic from the control room so we\u2019re hoping that\u2026it\u2014it\u2019s going to work. Let me introduce our distinguished panel of guests tonight.

Thank you, thank you all, and thank you to the Rosenkranz Foundation for their important work in\u2026making civil conversation really a reality in which we can all participate. Like to tell you a little story to begin. Uh, about two months after I started work at the White House in two\u20142001, there was a rap on the door, not a midnight rap, a daytime rap. Uh, my wife, um, went to answer the door, um, and there on the step was an agent of the FBI. Uh, showed her his badge, and asked if he might come in and ask a few questions. Our neigh\u2014next-door neighbor, he told her, had just, uh, been hired into a sensitive position in the federal government, and as part of the security check on the next-door neighbor he wanted to ask a few questions. So he asked my wife, uh, had we noticed anything unusual about them, did they seem to be living within their means, uh, did they, uh, conduct themselves responsibly and respectably in the neighborhood and\u2014 She was a little embarrassed because these were new neighbors, we did not know them well but to the best of her ability she gave \u2018em a clean bill of health. But jogged by this, she said, you know, we haven\u2019t had them over, we really should. So\u2014 So she invited the next-door neighbors over a few weeks later and they came and we poured tea and gave them cake and eventually my wife congratulated, um, them on, on the husband\u2019s new job with the federal government. He said, what are you talking about, he said I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m still at Sibley and Austin, I\u2019ve always been at Sibley and Austin. And what we realized, was, that the FBI had meant to come to their house\u2026 to ask them about me. Tonight\u2019s motion, is \u201cBetter\u2014better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11,\u201d and the question is, more than what? And my answer is, more than that. Now, none of us are here to argue, none of us are here to argue for limitless domestic surveillance. Um, the three of us on the affirmative side of this debate have a deep and abiding commitment to privacy and liberty. Um, my colleague, Andy McCarthy, has been a federal prosecutor, his job is to defend and uphold the US Constitution, the greatest liberty-affirming document in world history. My colleague John Yoo, was on the front line to defend all\u2014all of our liberties, and liberties of people all over the world, against, uh, totalitarian conspiracy. Not only that but in our private lives, Andy McCarthy is a conservative in New York, and John Yoo is a conservative at Berkeley, California. We understand, believe me, in the most intimate possible way, the importance of free thought, free expression, privacy, and the ability of human beings to speak their mind in debate and conversation, without fear of punishment or consequence or an overbearing state. But\u2026here\u2019s the question for today. Should we have more surveillance than we had when those FBI agents were knocking on the wrong door\u2026at, uh, a level of surveillance that made possible the tremendous catastrophe we know as 9/11, or should we continue with the path we\u2019ve been following since 9/11, toward, not a police state, not a nightmare regime in which you have no privacy. Is anyone in this room as a concrete matter afraid to speak his or her mind? I very much doubt it. But, um\u2026 That\u2019s just because your listeners are so cranky. Uh\u2026we, we are here\u2014 Uh, we are here to uphold\u2026a new level of surveillance, that is, uh, that is not made up of new techniques, it is made up of very familiar and traditional techniques, as my partners will argue, that is not onerous, that is not burdensome, that leaves all legitimate freedoms and privacies intact, and that is abundantly worth it, and in fact has proven over the past half- decade, has proven in the acid test of experience its merit. You know, 9/11 is beginning to be a little while ago. But the recent terrible events of\u2014at Virginia Tech, um, Technical institute\u2014the, the Virginia Tech University, remind us, remind us of the reality of danger and fear, uh, of\u2014that we all experienced in those terrible days. Now if we cast our minds back, back to that time, I think many of us will remember, we expected more of the same. We dreaded more of the same. And that was one of the reasons that, uh, the\u2014the sniper attacks in Washington were able to paralyze a great city. Because we were ready for something dreadful, something even more dreadful. And on American soil, it has not happened. But that does not mean that the threat is not real, in fact, if you sound the roll of world events since 9/11, you will be reminded how very, very real it is. In December of 2001, gunmen attacked the Indian parliament, and, uh, attempted\u2014 well, hoped, hoped to kill in fact very senior officials in the Indian government. They did kill a number of parliamentarians and some ci\u2014uh, civil servants, and some security guards, and very nearly succeeded in triggering a nuclear war, between India and Pakistan. We remember the bombing in Bali, uh, whi\u2014which took so many lives of, uh, Indonesians and Australians, and others who were, who were visiting that, that beautiful place. The Madrid Atocha railway station bombings. The bombings in London in 2005. Just this past year in 2006, attempted bombings, very serious attempted bombings, in Toronto, and in Germany, and tragically a successful bombing in Bombay, successful of course from the point of view of the terrorists. These\u2014the, the threat, the threat of mass-casualty terrorism, um, at the hands of people guided by a totalitarian ideology, remains a real threat. But here\u2019s the good news. What we notice as we look back on this half-decade of terrible atrocities, is a dwindling level of sophistication, behind each of these attacks. Uh, that the Atocha attack was much less sophisticated than the 9/11 attack, the London attack in 2005, less sophisticated than Atocha, and the attacks attempted this past summer were less sophisticated than those of 2005. The terrorists are finding it harder to coordinate, they\u2019re finding it harder to communicate with each other, they are under crushing international pressure. Now\u2026one of the ironies about this is, we don\u2019t\u2026entirely understand how this is happening, even inside our own law enforcement agencies. Here\u2019s one way to think about how a terrorist attack proceeds. If any\u2014if any of you have been in a toy store recently I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen those toys, where you drop a ball bearing, uh, through, uh, into a little slot and it whizzes and rolls and it catches the little teeter-totter and it goes through a basketball hoop, and it proceeds over many, uh, feet of track until finally it emerges out the other end. And there are a series all along the way of little switching points, and that\u2019s the game, to watch the ball jump and hop and skip and move past these various obstacles. Think of a terrorist plot as like that ball bearing. It starts, and it rolls and it unfurls. And it has to pass\u2014", "\u2014pass through a number of switching points. If you can make each of those points just slightly more difficult, you stop the plot in just the way the earth\u2019s atmosphere stops the meteorites, without any of us ever being aware of it. It is that level of in\u2014of in\u2014of intensified surveillance of illegitimate activities, that has complicated the life of the terrorist, not\u2014and has not made terrorism impossible, has not in any way lessened their desire to do people harm, but that has made\u2014that has broken up their ability to communicate with one another, that has made it more difficult for them to move money, and has made it much more difficult to strike, and especially to strike inside the United States. You know, all of us here, are people\u2014are, um, are people who love liberty. Who prize liberty, and who use liberty, as we are using it tonight. But we are also citizens of great cities in the Western world. And we are all potential casualties of attack. And the liberties we are using are the very thing, the very thing that inflames and provokes those who would attack us.", "We are here\u2014", "\u2014to defend that liberty, by defending the higher level of surveillance seen since 9/11.
